<p>Perhaps the noble aspirations contained in the lines
that head this chapter are misapplied to a murderer flying
his just punishment, but even to the felon-convict liberty
is sweet. L'Estrange, as soon as he was left alone,
began to think what he should decide on,&mdash;whether to
escape or remain. There lay the rope, and the file to
burst open the prison bars! All was prepared for his
flight. Why did he hesitate? Why did he linger?
Between the peals he heard the clock strike twelve;
he thought too he heard the clatter of horse-hoofs,
probably the Captain on his way home. Why did he
stay? he felt an irresistible inclination to await his doom.
Why? Because he would see Ellen once more! If he
went&mdash;if he escaped&mdash;he would perhaps never see her&mdash;he
would have to fly his country. He would stay.
Come what might&mdash;it was death at the worst! But
alas! the Captain, what would he think? he cared not
for that. But what would he <i>do</i>? He who had gained
admission to his cell could again do so; he who had
offered means of flight could also force him to fly; it
was useless then, after all he must go! Oh, that he
had never come! that man was his evil genius! "Farewell,
then, to Scotland, farewell, Ellen, I must go and
hide on a foreign strand." He then began to think
how he was to manage his escape. After all it was
not so very easy. What if he should fail? he had
already lost precious time! Bill would only wait till
three&mdash;he must be up and doing.</p>

<p>We must leave him a few moments in order to follow
the Captain home. When he had brought L'Estrange
to see escape was after all not to be trifled with,
slipping a cheque for a large sum into the turnkey's
hand he was let out by a side door. It was raining
torrents, and his only light were the rapid flashes that
lit the Welkin, and disclosed for an instant Arthur's
Seat, and then swallowed all in the jaws of darkness
again. He strode along whistling; if he met a watchman
made some casual remark, or damned the night, then
walked on again, taking his soaking with the utmost
coolness, till he came opposite the High School. There
he turned to the right, and descending a steep pathway
dived into the north back of the Canongate, threading
his way through the murky dirty habitations till Holyrood
rose dimly before him. Here he was challenged
by a sentry, but as he had possessed himself of the
password and countersign, was readily admitted. Passing
through the courtyard he again sallied forth, again
gave the password, and was at last clear of all buildings
in the Park now called the Queen's Park. He walked
on a dozen paces, and then gave a shrill whistle: another,
echo like, answered him, and he quickened his
pace to where Archy stood holding a horse.</p>

<p>"A soaker, by G&mdash;, Archy."</p>

<p>"'Deed, sir, it is a soft night for being out by!"</p>

<p>"Go and rout up old Stacy&mdash;he is at the King's
Tavern in High Street; tell him to watch for L'Estrange
at Hunter's Bog from one to three. Have three horses,
and ride to Prestonpans; there the smack is ready&mdash;don't
let him stay behind, he must fly the country. It's no
go about his sweetheart; he may perhaps carry her
off a wedded dame&mdash;I never promised her he shouldn't&mdash;but
I did promise she should get spliced. If he is obstinate
shoot him, do you hear&mdash;tell Bill to shoot him,
'Dead dogs'&mdash;you know the rest, Archy. Now off, you
young devil; you are as cunning as a fox; away&mdash;be
sharp&mdash;quick march!"</p>

<p>With these words the Captain mounted, telling
Archy to get a glass or two of grog to warm him, then
putting spurs to his horse he rode homewards at a
tremendous pace by a cross route for fear of being recognized.
When he reached the Holly Walk, Archy's
father met him, and took away the horse, which belonged
to his own farm.</p>

<p>The Captain then walked to the east tower of the
castle, crossed the bridge, and whistled an air beneath
one of the windows. He had not long to wait; soon a
window above was gently opened, and a rope-ladder
lowered, up which the gallant officer swung, entered the
room, and shook hands with Sir Richard. The window
was shut, and no one in the castle aware the Captain
had been absent, as he had retired earlier than usual
from his toddy, having a natural dislike to Sunday
evening.</p>

<p>"Is it managed?" said Sir Richard.</p>

<p>"Bravely&mdash;I had a d&mdash;d work to get round the old
turnkey, whose brutal pigheadedness was only equalled
by his gormandizing cupidity. Then L'Estrange was
well nigh sobered by his solitary confinement, and then
that accursed storm has soaked me through. Give me
a glass of brandy for God's sake. He must be gnawing
through his cage now&mdash;and he'll have a good shake
when he drops, for the rope wasn't half long enough!"</p>

<p>"Ha ha! what a joke! I should like to see his face
after it; but how will you know if he got through all
right?"</p>

<p>"Archy comes with the news to-morrow morning.
Now good night, I must get to bed; won't the judges
look blue? Egad!"</p>

<p>When Edward L'Estrange had made up his mind for
the attempt, he began to consider his best plan of effecting
it easiest; the window of course was the path to
liberty; but the window was at least twelve feet above
the ground, how was it to be reached? L'Estrange was
no fool, and soon hit on an expedient. He uncoiled the
rope, and found it was about twenty feet in length, and
made of silk, being both thin and strong; he then took
up the file; it was a foot in length, and in the middle a
smooth place, with the edges rounded off. Why was it
thus? It had evidently been made so? There was a
reason; the Captain told him he was no fool; he would
find it out. He was not long in doing so. To establish
a communication between the window and the dungeon
floor was the first point; there were three stout bars,
with iron points like teeth along their edges placed uprightly
in the window; if he could get the rope round
one of them, or in any way catch it, so as to bear his
weight scaling the wall? The reason for the file's shape
then struck him; so he tied the silk cord tightly round the
centre of the file, and threw the rope lasso-fashion so as
to fling the file through the bars, and drawing it back
sharply fix the line. The first throw missed; the second
time the file went through, but as he drew the rope
back, it slipped through the knot and fell. A thrill of
horror ran through him,&mdash;but fortunately it fell inside.
He seized the file as if it was his last friend, and resolved
not to hazard it again. What was to be done now?
The knife&mdash;yes it would do; so he made it secure much
in the same way, and he had a better hollow between
the haft and the blade. Again he threw it; the light
from the window was very slight, but after two more
failures he succeeded, and, catching the rope, tried if it
would bear his weight. It did, and he swarmed up, and
was soon seated on the window sill. He tied the rope
firmly round one of the bars, and then commenced filing.
The rain dashed in upon him, and the vivid lightning
once startled him so much he nearly fell back; but he
worked on, and after an hour's labour filed through a
bar; he forced it backwards and forwards till he loosened
the upper end soldered into the stone; at last it fell out
into his hand, and he then dropped it below in order to
gain from the length of time it took in falling a rough
estimate of the depth. He calculated it was at least
thirty-five feet. He had twenty feet of rope; he would
stretch nearly seven, leaving eight feet to drop,&mdash;nothing
after all! He descended once more into his
cell, secured his pistol, and climbed up again. He could
not suppress a laugh as he thought how scared his
gaolers would look when they found the bird flown. He
then wound himself through the bars and the wall, getting
somewhat torn and clawed by the spikes; but
liberty was before him, and he recked not of the pain.
After much squeezing and exertion he at last got on the
outside. He looked once more to see if the rope was
firmly knotted, waited for a faint flash of the waning
storm, and then began his descent. It was not long ere
he reached the <i>Ultima Thule</i> of his line; then with a
beating heart, he let go. It was a horrid feeling, that
letting go, and the fall in darkness! He had miscalculated
the height; instead of thirty-five, the depth was
forty-one or forty-two feet, and instead of dropping
eight, he had fourteen or fifteen feet to fall. He fell
with a heavy shock, bruising himself a good deal on the
slippery rocks down which he rolled. He was, however,
not materially injured, and when he looked back at the
perilous height he had come from, and looked at his
befouled garments dimly seen in the early dawning, he
laughed heartily, and, losing no more time, dived into
the Canongate, soon reaching the Hunter's Bog, where
he found his comrades waiting. At first he hardly distinguished
them from the rocks; then he saw the dark
outlines of horses and men; by-and-by he distinguished
Bill Stacy, Archy, and three horses. He quickened his
pace.</p>

<p>"Hillo, you young dog, so you've run the blockade?
A rascally time you have kept old Bill anchored in these
d&mdash;d moorings."</p>

<p>"Bill, how are you? I was as quick as I could be. I
thought I'd never saw through those d&mdash;d bars. How
they will gape when they find me off!"</p>

<p>"I have no time for words now; get aboard your
craft and away, or the bloodhounds will overhaul us."</p>

<p>"Away&mdash;where to? The old Peel."</p>

<p>"Not likely; away to the sea. You must give the old
land a wide berth. The Peel! good God! That would be
a wise <i>cach&eacute;</i> to hit on."</p>

<p>"But I must not&mdash;will not leave this country. Can
we not hide? What would happen?&mdash;they would be
married!"</p>

<p>"I don't care what would happen, or what wouldn't
happen. The ship has weighed anchor, and by it you
go; and be d&mdash;d to the wench!"</p>

<p>"Stay, Bill,&mdash;what if I say I won't?"</p>

<p>"Then I say I will shoot you. I am in earnest. So
you had better be led! What the devil makes you care
about a gal that don't care a straw for you?"</p>

<p>"Bill, what should you know of love?"</p>

<p>"What should I, or what shouldn't I,&mdash;up, I say, and
off. G&mdash;'s name, it is gettin' light!"</p>

<p>Finding there was no remedy, L'Estrange mounted,
and the three rode along the shore till they got to Musselburgh,
when Archy turned off to the right; Bill and
L'Estrange kept on till they reached a barren stretch of
sand and common, where three more men met them.
The five walked to the beach, where a smuggler's craft
was in readiness. Leaving one to take away the horses,
the other four embarked, and set sail. A fresh breeze,
which had sprung up after the storm, swelled the sails,
and they soon rounded the bay, steering southward.</p>

<p>Leaving them, we now return to the Towers. Of
course, the news of the escape was so unlooked for&mdash;so
startling&mdash;that for some time it was hardly credited. The
Earl, the Captain, and one or two others rode in to
Edinburgh, and found everyone at the prison in a vast
state of excitement. A more audacious escape had never
been perpetrated. Moreover, the turnkey was also missing,
and the detectives could gain no clue. Hundreds
of visitors saw the cell, the bars filed through, the rope
still hanging, and the tracks of the fall on the rocks.
Here, as a matter of course, all traces were lost, and it
was conjectured he might be hiding in some of the dens
of the old town. The most vigilant inquiries ended,
however, in nought. It was evident he had bold and
powerful confederates. The Earl was not without
anxiety about Ellen, and determined to take her from
the spot for some time. The marriage was fixed for the
first week in November, and meantime Lord and Lady
Arranmore invited the Earl, Lady Florence, and Miss
Ravensworth to spend a month or two at their residence,
Claremont Castle, close to Killarney. The Captain left
for Brighton, promising to be up at the marriage, and
bring Sir Harry Maynard, Major Forbes, young Pringle,
and others. The rest of the visitors left for their respective
homes, receiving an invitation to come to Dun Edin
Towers on the 8th of November, when the castle would
be all decked out for the ceremony. A letter from
Frank also announced he had got leave, and would come
home from Corfu in time for his brother's marriage.</p>

<p>We pass over the time spent at Claremont Castle, and
again introduce our readers to the dining-room at the
Towers, where a large party sat down to a very handsome
repast. At the head of the table sat the Marchioness
doing the honours of her brother's table with
the greatest grace; she had but lately made the Marquis
happy by the tribute of a son and heir to his titles.
On the right of the Earl sat his bride elect in blushing
loveliness, and down the long table we observe many old
faces amongst a tribe of new. Talking to a pretty girl sat
Sir Richard, about the middle of the table; directly opposite
him was the Captain. Frank, lately returned from
the Mediterranean, sat a few seats from the Marchioness.
Then there was Scroop, Wilson, and Sir Harry Maynard,
Major Forster, young Pringle, and numbers of ladies,
amongst whom Lady Florence shone next Johnny, who
was her devoted admirer; Mr. Lennox, Mr. Power, the
clergyman, and Mr. Ravensworth made up a large company.
The greatest merriment prevailed, and every one
was speaking of the approaching marriage.</p>

<p>"How have you amused yourself to-day?" said the
Earl, who had been in Edinburgh with Mr. Ravensworth
and Ellen, as he cut into the fine haunch of venison
that smoked on its massive silver plate; "it has been
snowing so hard, I suppose it kept you in the house."</p>

<p>"Snow doesn't keep me in," said the Captain; "I and
Pringle were riding, though most preferred the ladies'
company to snowy roads."</p>

<p>"Ah! we had the best of it," said Sir Richard, "had
we not, Sir Harry; knocking about the billiard balls with
the fair occupants of the Castle?"</p>

<p>"What? Why you don't mean to say you played
billiards all day, Sir Richard?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear no, my Lord; we spent most of the afternoon
in admiring your fine gallery of family pictures;
there's a long line of De Veres."</p>

<p>"Did you observe any peculiarity in the pictures?"</p>

<p>"I can't say I did, my Lord," answered Sir Richard.</p>

<p>"I did though," said Sir Harry; "and that was&mdash;excuse
me, Mr. Lennox, but you are taking white wine
with the brown vein of the venison"&mdash;(Mr. L. rectified
his error)&mdash;"that was&mdash;hock, if you please,"&mdash;(to the
footman)&mdash;"yes,&mdash;what was I saying? Some jelly&mdash;I
thank you,&mdash;yes, yes,&mdash;that your Lordship had placed
all the old personages on the right side, and all the
young on the left side of the fireplaces,&mdash;a curious
crotchet&mdash;some beer,&mdash;I thank you."</p>

<p>The Colonel was a great <i>bon vivant</i>.</p>

<p>"It is no arrangement," said the Earl; "but since
the time of Earl Hugh, or the Roundhead peer as we
call him, none of the family ever became old."</p>

<p>"A most curious fancy indeed! Here, Andrew, some
more hock; this venison is beyond all praise, my Lord,
cooked to the nicety of a minute,&mdash;a singular fancy to
prefer dying so early,&mdash;ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"It is no fancy, Sir Harry; you have evidently not
heard of the Weird of the Wentworths."</p>

<p>"Do, Lord Wentworth, tell it to us,&mdash;you have so
often promised," said Ellen.</p>

<p>"Of course," said the Earl; "I must do whatever a
lady asks,&mdash;especially what Miss Ravensworth wishes."</p>

<p>He then told the singular narrative of Augusta de
Vere, which we shall not repeat, as our readers already
are acquainted with it. Lord Wentworth had merely
wished to tell Ellen; but as he told a story remarkably
well, before he had finished he found the whole table
listening to him.</p>

<p>"A most singular and interesting story, my Lord,"
said Mr. Lennox; "but I opine we must give it the same
belief we give ghost stories in general."</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Lennox," said the Marchioness, "this is
quite unlike all other stories, because its truth is proved
by facts in the Peerage:&mdash;you will find no De Vere since
Hugh, Earl Wentworth, ever lived to be old."</p>

<p>"Certainly a curious coincidence, Lady Arranmore;
and possibly explained by the simple fact, the De Veres
are a short-lived family."</p>

<p>"But," said Lady Florence, "they were very long-lived
before, as the portraits show; you must never tell
a De Vere you misbelieve The Weird."</p>

<p>"There's no doubt about the matter," said the Captain;
"with everything to attest it, he must be a fool
who does not credit it; you will see all of us will be
knocked on the head soon enough,&mdash;girls first; but a
short and merry life for me!"</p>

<p>"Indeed, John, I don't see why we should die before
you," said Lady Arranmore. "I fear you will be the
first, with your fights and duels."</p>

<p>"Devil a fear; come, I'll bet I outlive both of you!"</p>

<p>"Come, I don't like this jesting," said the Marquis;
"it is a serious thing; and for my part I am like
Lennox, and don't believe in such nonsense."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Sir Harry; "you are all hale and well;
why should you think you will die so early? What a
splendid pine!&mdash;will you allow me to give you some,
Lady Florence?"</p>

<p>"I should think it was enough to make you quite
nervous, Lady Arranmore," said Ellen, still thinking on
the Weird,&mdash;"it is such a dreadful thing."</p>

<p>"No, Miss Ravensworth, we have become so accustomed
to it, and brought up in the belief, we are almost
proud of our doom,&mdash;we have learned to love it almost.
After all, I should not like to grow old and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hideous," said the Captain; "no, no,&mdash;whom the
gods love die young!"</p>

<p>"I fear, then, you will be the first old man, John, in
our family," said Lady Florence, laughing.</p>

<p>"A good one! How d'you like that, Captain?" said
Sir Richard, filling his glass. "Your health, De Vere!"</p>

<p>Without replying the Captain drank wine.</p>

<p>"If this is really an established fact," said Mr. Power,
"I think it should make you very serious; it is doubtless
intended as a warning; and if your days are to be
short on earth, do you ever think that, after death, there
is an endless existence of bliss or misery?"</p>

<p>"After all," said the Earl, "you are no better than
we are, Mr. Power;&mdash;none of us know our end."</p>

<p>"True, my Lord; but if, as you say, none of your
family live long,&mdash;and you are now all grown up,&mdash;the
time is short; and you should take the more earnest
heed to these matters."</p>

<p>"That is not my theory, Power: 'Happy for the day,
careless for the morrow,'&mdash;that's Scripture; at least it
was when I was a boy," said the Captain, whose ideas
of the Bible were not very correct.</p>

<p>"This is the very perversion of Scripture, my young
friend; when it bids us not be careful of the morrow,
it means we are to lay all our cares on One who has promised
to carry them."</p>

<p>"Well, Power, I am not learned in divinity; you stick
to your trade, and I will to mine; you be a soldier of
God, and I will a soldier of the King, or the devil, if you
like it!"</p>

<p>A suppressed murmur of disapprobation followed this,
and the Earl changed the conversation by a totally irrelevant
remark. Sir Richard, unfortunately for himself, as
the story will show, brought back the conversation by
saying they had found some striking resemblances to the
present family in some of the portraits.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the Earl. "And in whom did you
find my likeness?"</p>

<p>"In the seventh Earl,&mdash;Algernon, I think was his
name,&mdash;a young man in a hunting suit. Then we found
out a likeness for Lady Florence, in her grandaunt
Guendolen; and for the Marchioness in the Abbess
Augusta; but the best of all was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, please!" said Lady Florence, whispering
across Johnny; "don't say it; John doesn't like it."
(Whether he did not comprehend Lady Florence's meaning,
or whether he wished to prove the truth of her
assertion, we know not; but in an evil moment he
finished his remark)&mdash;</p>

<p>"&mdash;was the likeness to the Captain."</p>

<p>"And to whom do you liken me?" said the Captain,
in a gloomy voice.</p>

<p>"To whom? Why,&mdash;ha! ha! ha! I shall die with
laughter,&mdash;it was so like,&mdash;the old Roundhead peer,
Hugh. I'faith you might have been brothers!"</p>

<p>"I wish to God you would find likenesses to yourself,
and leave me alone! I like that old murderer, egad!&mdash;I
like that!"</p>

<p>"Come, there's no harm meant,&mdash;it's a mere joke."</p>

<p>"D&mdash;n joking," muttered the Captain,&mdash;"I like the
old Roundhead, egad!"</p>

<p>Lady Arranmore, fearing there was something looming
here, bowed to Ellen Ravensworth, and the ladies
rose and left the room. The Captain looked gloomy,
and appeared to have taken great umbrage at the unhappy
resemblance; it was not a newly found out likeness,
and even before this he had shown great wrath at
the allusion. It was never quite evident why he disliked
it, but at any rate it <i>was</i> evident he did so. When
the ladies were retired, Sir Richard, anxious to gloss over
his mistake, began&mdash;</p>

<p>"Really De Vere, you take mortal offence at a <i>jeu
d'esprit</i>."</p>

<p>"Sir Richard, you seem determined to work me up
to-night. I advise you to think twice before you do so,
or by heaven you may repent it."</p>

<p>"Why, De Vere, I think you are&mdash;I was going to say&mdash;crazy
to-night: I merely said you were like Earl Hugh&mdash;you
are like, and there let it end, I shall say no more."</p>

<p>The Captain was not inclined to let matters drop so
easily, and replied, "I shan't drop it in such a jolly
hurry; the fact is you have laid a plot to annoy me:
egad you have, you did it before the ladies, and now
you're raking the accursed thing up again, which proves
it. You compared me to that d&mdash;able old renegade
just to enrage me, by G&mdash; you did. I like that d&mdash;d,
round-headed old &mdash;&mdash;! You have insulted me, Sir
Richard. I am not the man to brook insults&mdash;you will
apologize&mdash;I demand an apology."</p>

<p>The whole room were listening in dead silence to the
quarrel, and Johnny, who had not yet left, was in high
delight at the prospect of a scene. No one interfered
yet, and the loud voice of the Captain as he demanded
an apology to most seemed at the least ominous.</p>

<p>"I have done nothing to give me cause to make an
apology; I appeal to the table, should I make one?
Lord Wentworth, what say you?"</p>

<p>"You have insulted me, Sir Richard, and by G&mdash; I'll
have one, or know the reason why. I don't care who
says you should not, I say you shall&mdash;I am waiting for
an apology!"</p>

<p>"You may wait, De Vere, till doomsday,&mdash;you may sit
there till you die,&mdash;but never will I apologize when I have
done no fault."</p>

<p>"You have committed a fault. Ha! I see you are
incapable of feelings like a man of honour; you must be
forced to feel as you should. Sir Richard, you say you
did not intend to insult me, I say you lie most foully in
your throat; there&mdash;will that do?"</p>

<p>A thrill of horror ran like an electric shock through
the company.</p>

<p>"Ha! you give me the lie, do you?" said Sir Richard,
blanching with rage, "then take that."</p>

<p>As he spoke he threw a glassful of port wine across
the table: the liquid hit the Captain on his mouth and
chin, and poured over his orders and medals, for he was
in full uniform. The revenge was quick as thought!
Uttering a fearful malediction, the enraged officer seized
a heavy cut glass tumbler, and threw it at Sir Richard
with unerring aim. The Baronet dodged aside from the
missile, and saved himself a blow on the centre of his
forehead, but he did not escape. The tumbler struck
him a terrific blow on his temples, and, as it flew into a
dozen fragments, inflicted a terrible wound. In an instant,
as by one consent, the whole table sprung to their
feet. For a moment, too paralyzed to speak, a deathly
silence reigned. The Captain's face was lit by a fiendish
smile, as he wiped the red wine off his breast. Sir
Richard's face was black with ire, as he staunched the
blood that covered his forehead with his kerchief. The
two foes looked as if they could have leaped the barrier
that severed them, and locked in each other's arms
divided not to death.</p>

<p>Soon a confused murmuring arose on all sides, and
then voices grew louder.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't stand that," said Wilson.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Frank.</p>

<p>"Give it to him, pitch into him, confound him, thrash
him, Captain," cried the Marquis, whose Irish blood was
at boiling point.</p>

<p>"Yes, pitch him out of the window,&mdash;kick him out of
doors&mdash;d&mdash;n him," cried Frank, catching the fire. "He
had insult enough to enrage a Moses."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;by heaven, sir! a glass of wine thrown at his
face, good wine too, a most ungentlemanly trick, and
unbecoming an officer of his Majesty's service," said Sir
Harry.</p>

<p>"They should fight it out," remarked Forster.</p>

<p>"Yes, give it him, Captain, do," said Johnny.</p>

<p>The clamour now grew uproarious, when the Earl's
voice was heard, loud and commanding,&mdash;"Silence, gentlemen,
I insist! I <i>will</i> be heard at my own table. Silence,
cease this brawling."</p>

<p>When order was restored, the Earl continued: "I am
deeply grieved such an unjustifiable proceeding should
have occurred at my table&mdash;that a scene which would
have disgraced a pot-house should have been enacted
here. I am surprised at Sir Richard's resenting an
angry insult in the way he did, and at my brother giving
him the lie, and then so far forgetting what was due to
himself, and to me, as to fling glass at any guest of mine.
I fear but one result&mdash;an hostile meeting&mdash;will wipe out
the dishonour. The thing is done now, and cannot be
undone, but at least let seconds be chosen, and all done
in a decent and gentlemanly way. In conclusion, I am
much hurt at my brother-in-law the noble Marquis
hounding on the antagonists in the way he did, and at
Frank's supporting him. I would have expected a boy,
like Johnny Ravensworth might have forgot himself.
I do trust this is the first and last time such a disgraceful
brawl will occur here, at least while I am master of
the Towers!"</p>

<p>The Earl then sat down, and was complimented by
several of the gentlemen for thus expressing his opinions.
Mr. Power urged the plea of apology, but little heed
was taken of him.</p>

<p>"Will you be my second, Arranmore?" said the Captain.</p>

<p>"Faith, not I," replied the Marquis, "I have made
fool enough of myself already. I will not meddle in
this unlucky matter any more."</p>

<p>"You have no such scruples, old boy," said the Captain.</p>

<p>"Not I," said Scroop, "I am your man."</p>

<p>"And will you be my second, Wilson?" said Sir
Richard, his voice tremulous with passion still.</p>

<p>"With pleasure, we are quite <i>au fait</i> at these things
on board ship."</p>

<p>"Come, Scroop, let's get to business; after all, Musgrave,
he had no business to give you the lie, and you retaliated
the broadside well."</p>

<p>"And he found his match by G&mdash;," said Scroop, as
he and Wilson walked aside, and in the most cold-blooded
manner arranged everything with the utmost
despatch&mdash;Time, place, weapons, and distance. "Time,
at once; place, the Holly Walk; weapons, pistols; distance,
twelve yards."</p>

<p>When these regulations were announced the Captain
ordered Andrew, who then entered the room having got
an inkling all wasn't right, to go to his room, and bring
a mahogany case down.</p>

<p>"Is't to be a duel?" said the old man, handing him
the case, which the Captain unlocked, and produced two
duelling pistols with black ebony handles, and inlaid
with silver; on each was a silver plate, and on one
neatly engraved three names with dates after them,&mdash;three
victims to the Captain's sure aim!</p>

<p>"You'll gie's permission to hae ane keek at yer
shootin', Captain."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;go to the devil."</p>

<p>"Sure, Captain, you're no in earnest; I was speerin'
if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come then, but for God's sake cease your clavering,"
said the Captain, cutting the old butler short.</p>

<p>The whole of the gentlemen then rose and followed
the principals and their seconds to the fatal spot. In
those days little heed was given to the evil of duelling,
and it would have made many modern ears tingle had
they listened to the light converse on the road. The
Marquis and Major Forster were betting on the likelihood
of the Captain's being shot or not, as Sir Richard
fired first, and the Major offered ten to one against him,
which the Marquis took, saying, he had little fear he
would miss his shot, unless he was hit through the head;
for even if he was mortally wounded in any other part
he would still give a dying, and probably a killing shot&mdash;he
was so famous for his pistol-shooting. The two
antagonists were each conversing with his second;
Frank and Sir Harry were laughing and joking; the
Earl and a large party were the quietest; and some few,
such as Mr. Power and Mr. Ravensworth, came not to
see the duel, but to strive and arrange a friendly termination
yet. A short distance behind, old Andrew, with
a tribe of footmen, followed; the butler was descanting
on the wonderful sureness of the Captain's shot.</p>

<p>"I would not be him to-night though, and Sir Richard
getting first fire&mdash;that's not a gentlemanly plan&mdash;both
should fire together," said an English valet.</p>

<p>"Deil a fear o' the Captain&mdash;an' he be na shot in the
heed, he'll hae his man! See him, he is as cool an'
unskeered as though he had the first bleeze! Sir Richard
is fey, I saw it a' the day&mdash;puir young man&mdash;his time
is oot!"</p>

<p>"It isna the first chiel he has shot," said young
Wilton, who appeared just then.</p>

<p>"Deed no, Jack&mdash;there's mayhap three, and mayhap
mair names scratched on his weapon&mdash;Mr. John was ay
a quarrelsome-like chiel&mdash;I mind him frae his childhood,
he was ay fechting and pummeling, an' noo he has
grown a man he but fechts wi' pistols."</p>

<p>"If neither are shot will they fight it out still,
Andrew?"</p>

<p>"In troth will they&mdash;but dinna you trouble yer pate
wi' sic nonsense&mdash;the Captin is na goin' to miss! Sir
Richard I'll na swer to, but I wud tak' my aith <i>he'll</i> no
miss."</p>

<p>The snow, which had fallen on and off during the whole
day, had ceased, the sky cleared, a sharp frost had set
in, and was already beginning to crisp the top of the
snow, across which in varied groups the guests and retainers
of the Towers walked. A few minutes brought
them to their journey's end, and they all assembled in
the Holly Walk. It was so named from the immense
holly hedges that rose on each side of the broad green
walk, and in the coldest weather was always a warm and
sheltered path. Now the hedges were weighed down
with the newly fallen snow, and the green grass covered
to the depth of some inches. In the north-east was
rising the cold round moon, which looked down on a
white world with a placid eye, soon to be awestruck by
deeds of blood. A few of the brighter stars challenged the
lady of the night, and asserted their prerogative of giving
light; and over the north and north-west the northern
lights shot out brilliant streamers. The air was shrewd
and biting, but no wind was stirring, and the only sound
that broke the stillness was the cranch of the footsteps
on the newly frozen snow surface. In the dark shadow
of the eastern side of the holly hedge was grouped the
whole company,&mdash;excepting the seconds, who were pacing
the right distance in the moonlit side of the walk. The
Captain was talking in a light manner to Sir Harry; it
was not his first, nor second, nor even third encounter,
and he seemed to treat the matter with great indifference.
Sir Richard had never before fought a duel, and though
he had first shot he was not wholly at his ease like his
antagonist; he stood by himself and silently watched
the distance marked in the snow. Popular feeling was
certainly on the Captain's side&mdash;he had heard them say
there was only one place to shoot his foe if he wished
to disable him from firing too, and he secretly resolved
to aim for his head. The Earl and several others
were speaking in a low tone on the coming dreadful
match; Mr. Power, Ravensworth, and Lennox, were
all three talking together, and Johnny some distance
behind.</p>

<p>"This is a most ungodly and lawless business, Mr.
Ravensworth," said Mr. Power; "we should try and
stop it&mdash;you as his lordship's future father-in-law should
have influence to prevent it."</p>

<p>"Mine is a delicate position, Mr. Power; much as I
should like to see things amicably settled, I do not like
interfering," replied Mr. Ravensworth.</p>

<p>"Certainly in your ministerial capacity, and as a
soldier of the Prince of Peace&mdash;it seems to me, Mr.
Power, this important duty devolves on you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it does, Mr. Lennox, and I am but an unprofitable
servant to fear man's displeasure; I must
magnify my office and try what can be done; but I
greatly fear it will be useless to try&mdash;nevertheless I can
but make the attempt."</p>

<p>With these words he walked to where the Captain
was standing, but seeing several persons round him he
proceeded further, where Sir Richard stood alone.</p>

<p>"Sir Richard, excuse my boldness in addressing a
stranger, but as a servant of God I cannot see His laws
broken without at least speaking His message. Sir
Richard, you are either going to leave this ground with
the stain of blood on your hands, or are going to rush
unprepared into your Judge's presence. I beseech you
pause, and make up this unseemly quarrel."</p>

<p>"I fear, sir, you do not know what you ask; it is impossible
for me to back out of this even if I wished,&mdash;and
I do not wish it,&mdash;without incurring the stain of
cowardice."</p>

<p>"Alas! Sir Richard, you fear the opinion of your
fellow mortal more than breaking your Maker's laws!"</p>

<p>"Sir, I admire your sentiments, and wish I could see
things in the light you do; I regret I cannot&mdash;it is useless
to urge me more, my mind is made up!"</p>

<p>"And God grant your peace with him is made up
too!" said the clergyman, turning sorrowfully away
towards the Captain, whom he thus addressed:</p>

<p>"Unhappy young man, ere it is too late, forgive your
enemy&mdash;you will leave this ground with your hands
stained in a fellow creature's blood, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Power, it is not unlikely <i>I</i> may be shot,
you are premature."</p>

<p>"And dare you meet your Maker with all your sins
full blown&mdash;dare you hurry unprepared&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Power, you came here to dine, and not to preach&mdash;Heaven
knows you have time enough on Sunday&mdash;so
you had better keep your sermons for those who will
listen to them."</p>

<p>"Ungodly man, I tremble for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is more than I do for myself. Come, stow your
sermons, old Squaretoes, and for God's sake, if I am to
be knocked off, let me end my life in peace. I'd rather
stand at a cannon's mouth than yours&mdash;Lord knows which
breathes hottest!"</p>

<p>Cast down, but not vanquished, Mr. Power next
attempted the Earl.</p>

<p>"For the love of Heaven, my Lord, use your authority
to put down this breach of God's laws, and man's also;
let not murder take place in sight of your castle."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry I have no power in this matter at
all, beyond seeing everything is done as it should be&mdash;else
I would not be here. My motto is let every man
mind his own business&mdash;you should apply to the
duellists."</p>

<p>"I have, my Lord, and woefully I have been served."</p>

<p>"Then, Mr. Power, I have no chance in the world."</p>

<p>"Lord Arranmore, will you not use your influence?"</p>

<p>"What in the devil's name have I to do with it?&mdash;
besides I have a bet of 50<i>l.</i> on the affair, so am not
likely to stop it if I could."</p>

<p>"I wonder to see you patronizing such a meeting,
Mr. Power; however, I suppose you are like your lay-brethren,
and curiosity overcomes consistency," said
Frank.</p>

<p>"Come, Mr. Ravensworth,&mdash;come, Mr. Lennox,&mdash;let
us leave this godless crew&mdash;I have done my duty
at least."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged, but must certainly stay," said
Mr. Lennox, who had no idea of missing the first hostile
meeting he had ever come in for. "I am a bit of a
doctor, Mr. Power, and my presence may be required&mdash;there's
Johnny Ravensworth, however, too juvenile for
such entertainments."</p>

<p>"Come, my boy," said Mr. Ravensworth; "come
along with us," following Mr. Power as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I stay, papa?" Then in an under tone,
"Confound Mr. Lennox; he is glad enough to find an
excuse, and vents his anger on me."</p>

<p>"No, my boy; come along directly. Do you hear
me?"</p>

<p>"Let the boy stay, Mr. Ravensworth," said the Marquis.
"It is well to accustom them early to this sort
of thing!"</p>

<p>"My Lord, I wonder at you. When you have been a
father as long as I have you will think otherwise."</p>

<p>"I'faith, were my boy a little older he should have
been here," answered the Irishman.</p>

<p>"You had better go, Johnny," said the Earl.
"Always obey your father. Sir Harry, here, will tell
you discipline is the mother of all good soldiering."</p>

<p>"Indeed is it, my lad; now, quick march; you are
delaying the encounter. And, by my stars! it is cold
work halting in the snow. I had rather be over that
excellent punch, all spoiling," said Sir Harry.</p>

<p>The three proceeded to the Towers without speaking.
Mr. Power and Mr. Ravensworth in silence, Johnny
often casting a wistful look back, and asking old Andrew
if it wasn't a shame to take him away, to which the old
butler answered in the affirmative: "Ay, ay, Maister
Johnny, it's a sair trial; yet Scripture saith, obey your
parents; mayhap ye'll fecht one your ainsell some o'
these days."</p>

<p>When the two gentlemen and their reluctant companion
reached the drawing-room, they were beset with
questions from the ladies, who had a most imperfect
knowledge of the affair.</p>

<p>"It is a dreadful thing," said Lady Arranmore. "I
wonder you did not try and stop it."</p>

<p>"God knows, madam, I did try. I had perhaps a
hearing from Sir Richard; but your brother's heart is as
hard as the nether millstone."</p>

<p>"I fear John is too often mixed up in these disgraceful
affairs."</p>

<p>"Why, Johnny," said Lady Florence, "I thought
you would have been there?"</p>

<p>"And so I would, had I had my own way; but I
was dragged off whether I would or no."</p>

<p>"Then you really think they will fight?" said a lady.</p>

<p>"I fear so, madam."</p>

<p>"But perhaps they may miss," suggested Ellen.</p>

<p>"Little fear of John," said Lady Florence. "But it
is awful."</p>

<p>"Indeed, madam, I am&mdash;but, God love us! there
goes one," said Mr. Power.</p>

<p>In fact, at the moment a clear ring of a pistol-shot
was heard; and, ere any one could speak, in quick succession
another echoed through the woods.</p>

<p>"I'll run and see," said Johnny; and he was gone
before any one could stop him.</p>

<p>We return to the Holly Walk. When Mr. Power was
gone the Captain said, "Now we've sent Squaretoes to
preach to the girls, we'd better be at work. It's d&mdash;bly
cold, and will spoil our shooting."</p>

<p>"All is ready," said Scroop, handing him a pistol,
while Wilson gave another to Sir Richard.</p>

<p>The Captain looked at the cap (the detonating system,
but lately introduced, was all the rage, and the pistols
were percussion), then let the dogshead press on the
nipple an instant, and, half-cocking the piece, walked
with Scroop to his stand. Sir Richard and Wilson
also took their places.</p>

<p>The scene was awful! Twelve paces from each other
stood the two antagonists; their seconds walked back
and joined the rest of the lookers on. Not a word was
spoken, save by old Andrew, who stood at the end of
the walk, beneath a cypress-tree, almost directly behind
the Captain, some thirty yards off, and kept up an
incessant channering, as the Americans call it. The
moon shone on one cheek of each of the foes. The
Captain had a devil-me-care aspect; and though he was
first to stand fire, seemed to reck little what happened.
Sir Richard looked very pale; perhaps it was the moon&mdash;perhaps
the thought he was about to shed a fellow-being's
blood&mdash;or be hurled into another world. Old
Andrew declared he was "fey."</p>

<p>At last, as if tired of the delay, the Captain's voice
was heard clear and loud: "If you are ready, Sir Richard,
I am."</p>

<p>Sir Richard cocked; the click seemed as if it rapped
every heart that heard it, save his whose life it threatened.
He raised the piece slowly, and, pointing it at
the Captain's head, took a cool, deliberate aim. A
slight frown gathered on the Captain's brow, who thus
saw his life menaced. Then came the flash&mdash;the
explosion&mdash;and the ping of the leaden ball, which rung
through the cypress-tree, making old Andrew "loup,"
as he said.</p>

<p>"Missed, by Jove!" shouted Wilson. "It was a
shaver, by&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before he could finish his sentence the Captain flung
up his pistol, and, without seeming to take any aim,
fired. The flash&mdash;the loud report&mdash;and then the thud
of Sir Richard as he bounded forward, and fell flat on
his face upon the snow!</p>

<p>Every one rushed to the fallen man&mdash;save one, the
slayer, who stood like a statue, with the pistol smoking
in his hand. The seconds turned Sir Richard over on
his back; in the centre of his forehead was a round,
bleeding hole.</p>

<p>One figure left the crowd, and, walking up to the
Captain, said in a husky voice, "Drilled, by G&mdash;!"</p>

<p>It was Scroop.</p>

<p>"Where?" replied the Captain.</p>

<p>Scroop put his finger to the middle of his brow.</p>

<p>"Where I generally hit. But I must go and have a
look. Not the first soldier I've <i>drilled</i>!"</p>

<p>With a calm face he stooped over his victim a moment,
and then, as he walked away, muttered, "Ha!
Dick Musgrave! thou wert a fool to quarrel with me.
That shortens our count by one. The grave keeps her
secrets!"</p>

<p>"This has had a more tragical ending than I imagined,"
said the Earl. "Andrew, have the remains
carried to the castle. Come along home," to Frank.</p>

<p>"Confound my ill luck!" said Major Forster to the
Marquis. "Poor Sir Richard seemed all of a tremble;
no wonder he missed!"</p>

<p>"Is he dead?" cried Johnny, running up.</p>

<p>"Deed as a nail," replied old Andrew, and away
Johnny ran.</p>

<p>Like a wild thing he entered the drawing-room, and
all the ladies gathered round him, pale with terror.</p>

<p>"He's killed," cried Johnny, out of breath.</p>

<p>"Who is killed?" said Lady Florence. "Who,
Johnny?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I didn't ask. One is; I saw them carrying
him."</p>

<p>"You careless boy," said Lady Arranmore. "Oh! I
hope it is not true! Here's some one who will tell us.
Oh! Captain Wilson, who fell?"</p>

<p>"Musgrave, of course, Lady Arranmore."</p>

<p>"But is he dead? Oh say no," said Lady Florence,
trembling with excitement and fear.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of a man living with an
ounce of lead through his brains, Lady Florence?
No, no; Richard of Musgrave breathes no more!
The Captain will have to fly the country. Ah! here
he comes."</p>

<p>As he spoke the Captain, accompanied by Scroop,
both booted and spurred, entered the room.</p>

<p>"Oh! John, how could you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! what have you done?" exclaimed his sisters.</p>

<p>"Lord help us! what's done can't be helped. I am
sure I am d&mdash;d sorry. But I must be off, so no recrimination.
Good bye, Edie. Good bye, little Floss. And
you, Miss Ravensworth. What, will you not even shake
hands?"</p>

<p>"I cannot&mdash;your hand is bloodstained!"</p>

<p>"Ellen, if you knew all you would thank me. You
do not know that Sir Richard was he who carried you
off," said he, <i>sotto voce</i>.</p>

<p>Ellen hid her face in her hands, and the young
officer turned away and clanked out of the room, bowing
to the other ladies.</p>

<p>"God forgive you this murder; and may you never
feel remorse for the deed!" said Mr. Power, as he strode
past him.</p>

<p>"Ha, my preacher! are you primed, and at it again?
Nothing like sticking to one's trade. You to your
Bible, and I to swords, guns, and pistols!"</p>

<p>"You will think better some day. I trust God will
break your heart in his own time."</p>

<p>"I am like to break your head if you detain me any
longer, old Snapdragon! Never you mind me. If I
get to the devil first I'll fire a salute when you come!
Till then, adieu."</p>

<p>Leaving the worthy man to mourn over his wickedness,
our hero proceeded to the hall, where all the
gentlemen were grouped, talking to his brother and
the Marquis. He and Scroop hastened to the courtyard,
where young Wilton stood with three horses, ready saddled
and bridled, to carry them and Archy to Leith,
where they were to set sail at once for the Continent.</p>

<p>"I'll show my face again when this has blown
over," said the Captain, as he mounted. "Poor Sir
Richard! I am very sorry for him,&mdash;unlucky devil as
he was. You will see he is decently buried. He'll
have a warmer time of it than we shall, if Power speaks
gospel."</p>

<p>"Well, good bye, John. Write to us sometimes,"
said the Earl, giving him a pocket-book. "This has
been a most unfortunate night; it will delay my marriage,&mdash;and
get me into a jolly scrape, too."</p>

<p>"Egad! I'm deuced sorry; but Ellen won't spoil for
keeping a bit. Ha, the needful; I had forgotten that.
Thanks&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' I was thinking you would aiblins no be sorry to
hae a keg of the gude stuff," said old Andrew, handing
a big-bellied flask of whisky. "Gude save us, Captain!
yon was a grand shot&mdash;puir Sir Richard!"</p>

<p>"Why, bless me, you are a better fellow than I
thought, Andrew! Here, Scroop, you carry this flask;
we shall be glad of it, I warrant. What a d&mdash;d night
it is; the snow will be balling in our nags' feet, and
leave a track for a blind man to follow. But we must
be off. Good night, gentlemen. Come, Scroop, for
God's sake be mounted and away, or we shall have the
hounds on our scent!"</p>

<p>The horsemen then spurred off, and were soon lost in
the darkness. The guests returned into the hall, and
went upstairs.</p>

<p>When the Earl entered the drawing-room, Ellen
drew him aside, and, in the mildest, gentlest manner,
told him how sorry she was that this had occurred.</p>

<p>"You are right, dearest. I am very sorry, but it is
done now; it will delay our union, Ellen, for six
weeks, and that will be punishment enough for me. I
have your forgiveness, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Ask God's forgiveness, not mine; for this has been
a sad&mdash;sad evening."</p>

<p>To tell the truth the Earl was little pleased at the
part he had taken in it: but he had a hard part to
play; brought up without the least religion he had only
lately come to see the harm of duelling. Ellen's example
was silently doing a world of good, and she saw it, so
she said no more: those few words told more on him
than a hundred sermons.</p>

<p>The irreligious character of the Towers was well
known; and the way in which this awful affair was
treated will sufficiently show it, and our readers will see
how difficult it was for the Earl to change his course all
at once. He had laughed and joked on such occasions
before, and he was not so changed yet that he was
beyond the influence of the evil current.</p>

<p>As he left Ellen, Frank entered the room, equipped
for riding.</p>

<p>"Why, De Vere, where the deuce are you off to?"
said young Pringle.</p>

<p>"I am going to Piershill&mdash;do you think I am going
to sleep here to-night, with Sir Richard lying below?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Frank," said Lady Florence, "I wish you had
not put that into my head; I am quite nervous&mdash;I wish
I did not sleep alone!"</p>

<p>"Then you should make friends with his ghost, Floss!"
said her brother, laughing.</p>

<p>Without appearing to notice his remark, Lady Florence
prevailed on Ellen to share her room that night.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be you, youngster," said Wilson to
Johnny; "you are next cabin to him."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother it!&mdash;Lord Wentworth, may he be
moved?"</p>

<p>"No, no, Johnny," said the Earl, who could not help
relishing the dreadful jest&mdash;"he has been knocked about
enough for one night. You may sleep in another room;
but I put my veto on moving him again."</p>

<p>"Well, who will come to Piershill?" said Frank; "I
am not going to ride alone&mdash;Arranmore, come along!"</p>

<p>"Faith, not I&mdash;I never feared Musgrave, alive or
dead! Besides, I am married; I have my wife to defend."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's well enough; but we poor devils who
have no wives must look out for company. Come, will
no one accompany me?"</p>

<p>"I think I had better weigh anchor and be off," said
Captain Wilson; "I have had far too much to do with
it to moor myself here and be snapped up by the sharks!&mdash;only
for God's sake don't put me aboard that vicious
craft young Nimrod again."</p>

<p>"Good night, then&mdash;and don't dream about ghosts,
Florence," said Frank, as he and Wilson descended.
"It is not I am really afraid you know, Wilson; but
I want to tell the news at the barracks."</p>

<p>The two young men were soon mounted, and riding
along to the cavalry barracks, where the 10th Hussars
were now quartered. When they reached the barracks,
they found the yard full of men and officers, crowded
round a soldier who had lately dismounted.</p>

<p>"Hallo! here's some one who can enlighten us better
than this d&mdash;d Paddy!"</p>

<p>"How are you, De Vere?&mdash;so you've had a duel at
the Towers?" said Captain Ross.</p>

<p>"How the devil did you learn the news? Well, that's
a nice sell for me,&mdash;coming all this way to tell you
stale news."</p>

<p>The explanation was given that one of the troopers
had been supping at the Towers that evening, and, with
true Irish wisdom, having heard there had been a duel,
and one of the duellists killed, without staying to inquire
which had fallen</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"much aghast,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>He could only tell that the Captain and Sir Richard
Musgrave had had a duel: one was shot dead, but he
could not say which.</p>

<p>When Frank came with the full particulars, he slipped
away and had a long argument with a stolid Scotchman,
about who fired the first shot.</p>

<p>"Come, De Vere, who was the slain?" said Major
Cathcart;&mdash;"I will bet five to one it was not John De
Vere!"</p>

<p>"You're right;&mdash;Musgrave was done for&mdash;shot clean
through his forehead."</p>

<p>Frank then detailed the whole to a throng of officers
and sergeants in the mess room, and did not omit the
joke about his riding there for fear of the dead man.</p>

<p>"You should have brought him here," said the Major;
"we are not afraid of dead bodies!"</p>

<p>A yell of laughter followed this savage jest; and
they then all sat down to a wining party, and drank
the dead man's health in silence ere they retired!</p>

<p>Captain Wilson departed next day for the Continent.
Sir Richard Musgrave's remains were interred in the
vaults at the Towers; and the Earl had some trouble to
clear himself of the scrape. The marriage was deferred
till the 18th of December, the Earl choosing the same
day he had met Ellen a year before at the Duke's ball.
A letter from the Captain arrived shortly before that
day, saying he was at Hamburgh; had met a delightful
young Polish officer, Count Czinsky, who was also there
for a similar lawless deed, and they were to proceed to
St. Petersburgh almost immediately.</p>

<p>There is something peculiarly sad in the reflection that
even the works of man are longer lived than himself.
The gray castle, the ancestral residence of proud races,
outlives its lords; the trees man plants shall wave green
long after he has mouldered in the tomb; the very
picture exists long after the original has ceased to be
known in his place. But it is this very fact that lends
so much romance to the old castle&mdash;the ancient tree, on
whose trunk is carved many a long-forgotten name&mdash;the
dusky portrait, which retains the likeness of old ancestors,
and snatches them from the oblivion of the
dead! There is little interest in the new mansion; we
could well afford to dispense with all modern luxuries,
could we gain some old traditionary story of the house
we dwell in.</p>

<p>The Towers was the most ancient castle in all
the neighbourhood; it had been brought into the De
Vere family through a Scotch heiress&mdash;her name had
long been joined with De Vere, but the custom had
grown into desuetude. The Towers had stood unchanged
for many a century; its lords had mouldered
away, not so its battlements; its chieftains had died the
death, not so its buttresses; not so its four lofty towers,
on one of which floated the banner of the family, and in
one of which slumbered the mortal remains of many of
its stout possessors and fair mistresses. It had seen every
vicissitude of its owners, but owned little change itself.
The bride and the bridegroom, the dead had been borne
over, and the mourners had trodden its halls. If its
walls could have spoken they could have divulged many
a dark secret, related many a dark deed. It seemed as
if in silent night it mourned the departed, as if in
sunny day it rejoiced with the living. These thoughts
have been suggested by the lines that head the chapter,
and the sequence will show they are not wholly without
their meaning.</p>

<p>The old castle was shortly to see some more of the
vicissitudes of life&mdash;marriage and death, which, like
light and darkness, are perhaps the most dissimilar
events of life, yet often go hand in hand, indeed so often
that in Scotland it is a common saying, "A marriage
and a death." It is useless to inquire into the origin of
any superstition, it is enough to say without good cause
it could hardly have attained the universal belief it
does. The author can testify that in his short experience
the truth of this proverb has too often been exemplified.</p>

<p>The winter which had set in with a rigour unusual at
the early season of November, had betaken itself to
more northern latitudes, and a sort of Indian summer
had lasted during the two first weeks of December; so
mild indeed was the temperature that several trees were
putting out an early leaf to be blighted by coming frosts.
The 18th of December, the day fixed for the Earl's
wedding, opened mild and fine; a good deal of cloud
was drifting across a sky of remarkable transparency,
which is often the case when the atmosphere is saturated
with moisture. The sun was warm, the grass
shining in his beams as he lit up the raindrops of the
preceding night; a few swallows, which had not yet
taken their departure, darted at the gnats and other
insects the unseasonable weather had tempted out.
Altogether there was nothing unusual in the day, and
whatever man might intend it seemed pretty certain
nature would roll her course unaltered, and heed little
whether her rain or sunshine fell on the festal day.</p>

<p>At an early hour Ellen Ravensworth awoke; it was
hardly light when she rose, and after repeating her
morning orisons to God, began to realize this was actually
the last day she would rise as Ellen Ravensworth,
and really the day of her marriage. A crowd of differing
thoughts hurried through her brain. Her life had
been like a dream since that morning last year; long as
the days had seemed passing, now it was like a watch of
the night. It seemed but yesterday she had risen in
her own room at Seaview, and not even known him
who would that night be her husband. It was but a year
ago she had risen with her head full of the ball, and
had been marvelling whether she would be introduced to
the Earl. Her castle building had for once turned out
true, her visions had been realized, and here, on the
selfsame day, one year after, she rose in the castle which
would be her own that evening. She was about to be
united with him she had so singularly met, and so long
and dearly loved. It was but a twelvemonth ago, but
since that day how strange had been her life! Into
that short year how much had been crowded&mdash;her introduction
to the Earl; the accident of his cloak to protect
her going home; the drive in the sleigh; the evening
at the Towers; and the memorable ring which still
gemmed her finger. Then had come the departure of
her noble friends; the fatal but lying news; the fever
that had prostrated her on a bed of suffering, and well-nigh
extinguished the lamp of life; the journey in
foreign lands; the meeting with her best friend, Edith
Arranmore; then the Earl's first visit, and L'Estrange's
last heartbroken appeal. And here her thoughts partook
of gloom, for she could not exculpate herself of
blame; she had certainly cast him off, and <i>her</i> change
of sentiments had wrought his ruin; he had told her
they would, and they had done so. Her delightful
visit to the Towers; the picnic; the false Italian;
her wooing in the cool grot; and then the disappearance
of L'Estrange; her awful abduction; the
week of captivity; the miraculous intervention of Providence
in sending Juana; the dreadful combat and
capture of her old lover; his bold and unaccountable
escape from prison; then the fearful tragedy of Sir
Richard Musgrave's death; the flight of the Captain;
his last words, and her secret knowledge of his guilt;
her uncertainty of the future; these and many other
such thoughts were ample food for contemplation while
she dressed. Her joy was darkened with fears. Where
could he be? He would not be inactive; still she had
the word of the Captain she should be married, and she
believed the dark mysterious man. Her joining her
fates with such a remarkable family was another cause
of anxiety. How soon might he whom she loved so well
be cut off? how soon her sisters be withered in their
bloom? She could not doubt the Weird! it was like a
voice of death in the song of her nuptials. Then too
linking herself with such a man as the brother of the
Captain, there was horror in the very thought! There
was sunshine still on the very clouds of fear, one thought
silvered the edge of that darkest cloud. She felt that
she might be the favoured instrument of doing much
good to the family. Already she saw a change for the
better in her dear friend Edith; she had often spoken
to her on religious subjects, and at the least she was an
anxious inquirer after the truth. She had the greatest
hopes of Lady Florence too; and, best of all, what might
her influence do for the Earl? He was young, generous,
hospitable, kind; his very faults were virtues run
wild. She determined, with the blessing of God, her
silent walk and secret influence should guide him,&mdash;the
Christian wife might do much for the unbelieving husband.
Frank too was tractable, and very young; and
then there was the Captain, alas! it seemed the despair
of very hope to think of reforming him; but nothing
was too hard for One, nothing impossible, and she
hoped!</p>

<p>From these meditations, and the glorious thoughts of
leading a whole family in the right way, she was disturbed
by the entrance of Lady Arranmore, who clasped
her in her arms and wished her all joy on the auspicious
morning. The two friends then descended to the Earl's
study, where Lady Florence and Mr. Ravensworth were
both present. They were soon afterwards joined by the
Marquis, Frank, Maude, and Johnny, making a family
party of love and unity. One only was absent,&mdash;the
Captain.</p>

<p>This happy family circle soon joined the company
assembled in the parlour, where a merry breakfast party
congratulated the bride elect on the dawning of her
wedding-day. The marriage was to take place in the
evening, according to olden custom, and a marriage
supper instead of the more modern dejeuner. Of course
during the day all was bustle and preparation for the
coming event; Ellen, however, found time for a walk in
the garden with her bosom friend the Marchioness.
Their friendship was no common one, and it was the
prospect of parting from Edith Arranmore, though only
for a short time, that cast the only shadow on Ellen's
sunshine of joy. Their conversation was melancholy&mdash;much
on the unhappy Edward L'Estrange, and from
him they ran on to Sir Richard's death, and then to the
Weird and Lady Augusta.</p>

<p>"I am sure, dear Edith, it is unlucky to talk thus on
my wedding-day; let us talk of all the happiness of life,
and leave its miseries for another time."</p>

<p>"Ah! Ellen love, it is on these seasons of festivity
that sometimes I feel most low; before every ray there
is a shadow, and it is often that the most happy seasons
engender the most unhappy thoughts."</p>

<p>"And why should you think so? this should be the
happiest day to both of us; do you remember at Geneva
you told me I looked on the dark side, and you looked
on the sunny; methinks we are changed, and I now
gaze on the light, and you on the darkness."</p>

<p>"Ellen, I cannot deceive you, but I have a dread
feeling there hangs something sad over all this; in our
family, presentiments are not disregarded; you link your
fortunes with ours, and must not smile at my follies."</p>

<p>"Edith, darling, you alarm me; you know nothing,
do you? surely you have nothing to apprehend; tell me,
love, hide nothing from your sister."</p>

<p>"I know nothing, but Ellen I dreamed last night my
departed sister stood by me; in her hand she held a
miniature. I looked at it and saw an infant's counterpart,&mdash;it
was our lost Arthur's picture,&mdash;she beckoned with
her hand, and when I rose to follow she smiled, then
gazing on the miniature she looked so unhappy, and
said: 'Lost&mdash;he is not there&mdash;he is lost!' I woke&mdash;I
am telling you no fancy&mdash;I saw some one glide
from the room. I am not easily frightened, Ellen,
and I rose&mdash;I followed to the door, and there distinctly
saw a form like Augusta's glide down the long corridor.
I could not sleep again all night, and when I now think
on it I feel sure some evil lurks near; why she showed
that baby form I know not; God grant it may not affect
my own Arthur; if my child died, I should follow, Ellen,&mdash;Augusta
need not beckon!"</p>

<p>"Edith, love, we should trust God before even presentiments;
if we fear Him all will work together for our
good, and even from evil good will spring forth."</p>

<p>"Ah! Ellen, if I had the trust you have; but I
cannot overcome my fears; God grant they may all be
shadows! But here is Wentworth, he must not see
clouded faces, let us try and forget this."</p>

<p>The large ball-room at the Towers had been fitted up
as a chapel for the occasion, to the scandal of the prelate
who was to perform the ceremony; he considered it
almost equal to fitting up the temple of Baal as the
house of God! About seven in the evening the chapel
was full to the very doors with guests in the most brilliant
attire. The Bishop of Edinburgh with his full
lawn sleeves, attended by two clergymen, entered the
apartment from a side door, and walked up to the altar.
Almost immediately after from the right hand side Mr.
Ravensworth, with the bride leaning on his arm, appeared,
and behind him two by two fourteen bridesmaids, including
nearly all the beauty of the neighbourhood. The
fairest perhaps of all was the bridegroom's sister, Lady
Florence. At the same moment the Earl entered from
the opposite side with Lord Dalkeith, who acted in the
capacity of best man, or as our southern cousins call it,
bridegroom's man, and several other gentlemen, including
Frank and the Marquis. The two parties met
before the altar, when the solemn service of the Church
of England was beautifully performed. Every one
allowed that they were the handsomest couple that
almost ever stood before the hymeneal altar. And
when all was done, the ring given, and the Earl took his
young and lovely partner, all who beheld his tall and
stately figure, whilst on his arm leaned his blushing bride,
veiled in lace that enhanced the charms it could not
hide&mdash;unable to contain their joy shouted, "God save
the noble pair."</p>

<p>The Earl and Ellen, now Countess of Wentworth,
then led the way to the drawing-room, where all her
friends crowded round the young peeress, and wished
her every joy. In the fashion of the good old days the
happy pair graced the supper with their presence, and
after the toasts were all given, speeches made and
returned, the Countess rose and left with Lady Arranmore
to attire herself in her travelling dress. In a short
time she again appeared, and the Earl offering his arm
to his bride, hastened down stairs to the hall door,
before which stood a splendid carriage with four greys,
all adorned with ribbons. The Countess gave a last
long embrace to Edith, kissed Florence, her father,
brother, and sister, and then waving her hand to the
other guests took her lord's arm, and hurried into the
carriage amid a storm of satin shoes, bouquets, and
blessings. The Earl's valet, and the Countess's lady's-maid
leaped up behind, crack went the postilions' whips,
round went the wheels, and the happy pair set off for
Edinburgh, where they were to pass the first night, and
soon after to start for the Villa Reale, at Naples,
where they intended spending the honeymoon. When
the Earl and his bride were off the entertainment at the
Towers was kept up with the utmost spirit. The Earl
had resigned his castle to the Marquis and Edith, and
the former was determined to end the day well, which
he did with a vengeance, and it is whispered the noble
lord was helped up to his room by old Andrew, who
patted him on his back and told him he was the real
gentleman, and three other footmen. The Marquis kept
up the feast during the whole week following, when the
Towers were, as on all such occasions, open hall, "and
while he feasted all the great," we must do his lordship
the justice to say, "he ne'er forgot the small." Still this
was a cheap charity, for all came out of the Earl's pocket,
and while <i>he</i> would have felt hurt had it not been so,
the Marquis had the extreme delight of winning laurels
on another's hospitality. He was determined to end
matters by a grand flare up, so he invited almost the
whole of the gentry of the surrounding country to the
great ball, given in honour of the Earl's marriage. All
the rank, beauty, and fashion, not only of Edinburgh but
the north as well as the south borders of the Tweed were
to be there, and no expense spared to make it worthy of
the occasion. On the evening of the ball the Marquis
was in high feather; everything had gone on well so far,
every one had accepted, the ball-room was splendidly
festooned with holly and mistletoe, through whose dark
leaves glittered a thousand tapers, giving almost the
light of day; the boards were chalked with elegant
devices, the tables below groaned with a magnificent
supper, the castle was illuminated within and without,
and joy was on every face, and laughter on every tongue.</p>

<p>"Ha! Lennox, isn't this grand?" said the Marquis, as
he and Mr. Lennox entered the ball-room, in full
evening costume. "The room is silent enough now, how
different it will look in a few hours, when hundreds are
tripping it on the light fantastic toe."</p>

<p>"Indeed, my lord, nothing befitting the auspicious event
is wanting now, except the guests; all is prepared, and
all does justice to your lordship's taste."</p>

<p>"By Jove, Arranmore, you have lights enough here;
it reminds me of the valley of a thousand fires," said
Frank, entering in full uniform. "The fun will soon
begin now; why bless me, there went the bell,&mdash;some very
unfashionable arrival."</p>

<p>"Bedad," cried the Marquis, who sometimes used a
true Irish expression, "guests arriving and the Marchioness
not here to receive them, I must go and hurry
her. Come, Lennox. Frank, stay here and do the polite."
The Marquis and Mr. Lennox proceeded along the
corridor till they were near the Marchioness's room when
they heard a long, loud, harrowing scream, and "Help&mdash;fire&mdash;fire!
Oh, help."</p>

<p>"God of heavens!" shouted the Marquis, "what's the
matter?"</p>

<p>This question was answered by the sudden bursting
open of the door, and the wild figure of the Marchioness,
enveloped in flames, rushing madly to seek aid. When
she saw her husband, uttering another piercing scream,
she flung herself into his arms. All flaming as she was
he sprang with his fiery burden to her room, and tearing
down the crimson curtains from her bed wrapped his
unhappy lady in their dense folds, while Mr. Lennox
tore a blanket off, with which he succeeded in extinguishing
the flames. Frank, and several others,
startled by the scream, entered the room, and every
device to alleviate the unhappy lady's sufferings was
resorted to. Fortunately there was more than one
door man in the house at the time the accident
happened, and all that medical skill could do was done
promptly and well. The flames had apparently but
breathed upon her tender form, but the shock was too
much for the nervous system, and when the fearful
sufferings gave way to remedies, the harrowing screams
grew fainter, and at length ceased, giving the Marquis,
who was wild with grief, some hopes: the unfortunate
young lady, however, gradually sunk, and about midnight
the dying lamp of life expired. Perhaps the most
melancholy part was the detailing of the fatal news to
the carriages full which arrived every minute with their
inmates ready for the dance, and sadly shocked at the
awful catastrophe which had so unexpectedly turned
rejoicing into misery.</p>

<p>How sad was the chamber of death! Stretched lifeless,
but beautiful in death, the hope of age, the joy of her
husband, the kind, the generous&mdash;lay unheeding, but not
unheeded. Kneeling at the couch's side, the Marquis
hid his agony on his lifeless partner's bosom, and wept in
uncontrolled grief. The fair Lady Florence, arrayed in
her ball dress, wrung her hands and wept in wild despair,
with her golden tresses all dishevelled, flowing over her
lost sister. There were many other mourners, and no
sound but the suppressed sobs of man, or the unconfined
weeping of woman broke the gloom of the chamber of
death.</p>

<p>How would <i>they</i> hear the news? was often asked.
Who shall tell the bridal pair? How had laughter
languished into groans! how had they proved that in
the midst of life we are in death! A week after this
event a very different ceremony was performed by the
same prelate. The same room, not adorned for the
wedding but hung in funeral black, saw a very different
sight. In the centre of the chamber, on a table covered
with black, stood a gorgeous coffin of crimson velvet and
gold, around it in the garb of woe stood the eight pall-bearers.
Behind it the chief mourners&mdash;the Marquis
and Frank de Vere.</p>

<p>The first part of the impressive and beautiful burial
service was read by the Bishop&mdash;then the coffin containing
all that remained of youth and beauty, was
slowly and solemnly borne through the long passages
hung in crape, through the great hall to the doorway,
where a hearse drawn by six horses, with black drapings
and nodding plumes, received its lifeless burden; and
the horses, tossing their plumed heads, paced across the
drawbridge, whilst the mourners walked in sad procession
behind. The white feathers on the hearse told that one
young in this world had early run her race.</p>

<p>They had not far to go&mdash;the west tower of the castle
was soon reached, and again the coffin was borne into the
arched room over the family vault, and was placed on the
drop. For the last time the mourners gathered round the
narrow bed of the loved and departed one. The
chamber, or rather cloister, in which they stood, was
well adapted for the mournful spectacle. The windows
were narrow, the roof low, and supported by ribbed
pillars; on either side were low benches, all robed in
funeral black; the floor was also covered with black
cloth, the walls draped with the same, and the pillars encircled
with wreaths of cypress and yew branches; along
the walls, through the black squares cut in the cloth,
glimmered, ghostlike, the marble tablets recording the
names and ages of all the former departed members
of the De Veres, whose bones mouldered beneath. Everything
was black and funeral-like. The only exception
was the coffin, whose crimson velvet lining, gold plates
and ornaments seemed almost strange in contrast.</p>

<p>The Bishop continued the service, and at the right
place the bolt was withdrawn, and the drop with the
coffin began to sink silently to its long last resting place.
At this moment a young girl in deepest black advanced,
and placed a wreath of white roses on the coffin. Lady
Florence, for she it was, then turned away, buried her
face in her handkerchief, and gave utterance to her feelings
in a paroxysm of tears; her brother Frank supported
her from the scene of woe, and seemed himself
hardly to be able to control his grief. Gradually the
coffin sank, till at last only the white circle of roses was
visible; then it, too, disappeared; a crimson reflection
from the coffin flushed the black drapings a moment as
it sunk, and tinged with its hue the mourners' faces as
they bent over the narrow chasm to catch the last
glimpse. Then all darkly disappeared, and then first
it seemed as if the last link was broken. The Marquis
and many others quite gave way, and sobbed aloud.
Then all departed save those whose duty it was to descend,
and place the coffin in its proper position.<a name="FNanchor_A_" id="FNanchor_A_"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_" title="See Note I. The Funeral." class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>The vault was long and narrow; on either side were
three rows of black marble slabs, on which were placed
many coffins, containing the ashes of former generations.
Between Lady Augusta's coffin, which was of white
velvet, with silver lace-work, on which, too, a wreath of
the flower l'immortelle was still as fresh as on the day
when it had been placed there, and the gorgeous coffin
of the late Earl, they placed the newly arrived burden.
Immediately above the slab on which the Marchioness's
remains were placed was a singular spectacle&mdash;an empty
coffin of an infant! The lid was resting against the wall
behind, inside was a soft pillow and satin coverings, but
on the pillow rested no infant head&mdash;it was empty!
This was the house of the dead, ready for Arthur Viscount
de Vere, whose remains were never found to fill
it. By the narrow bed of all that was dear to him stood
the Marquis with folded arms; he then clasped his hands
together, leant over the head of the coffin, and for some
moments seemed as though he could never leave it.
Then, summoning all his resolution, he cried, "Farewell,
Edith, farewell! my feet may wander far from thee, but
my heart lies buried here." He then rushed away
from the maddening scene, followed by the others who
had descended with him, and they left the departed alone
amongst the ashes of the former dead, till the last trump
shall sound, and the mortal rise immortal!</p>

<p>When the Marquis reached the castle, he gave himself
up to unrestrained grief, and refused to be comforted for
many days. He then left for his seat in Ireland, taking
with him his infant son, the only pledge of undying love!
Frank and his sister left for their town residence, and
the castle was shut up, old Andrew and some of the servants
only remaining. The escutcheon was edged with
black, and the old Towers looked as if they shared their
owner's grief, and mourned for the dead. Young Wilton
had started immediately for Naples, bearer of the dreadful
tidings to the Earl and Countess, who would long
be in happy ignorance of the sad event.</p>

<p>Thus was another instance of the early death of the
family added to the long and mournful category!</p>

</div></div>


<p>We leave the darkened home of the De Veres, and shift
the scene to the Villa Reale at Naples, where the Earl
and his bride are enjoying the soft airs of Ausonia,&mdash;happy
in their own company, and asking for no friend to
intermeddle with their joy. More than a fortnight had
passed away on their journey, which was performed by
easy stages; another week had flown since their arrival
at the villa; still they were ignorant of their bereavement.
Ellen had penned more than one epistle to her
friend, giving a glowing account of their happiness, the
pleasures of the journey, the delightful weather, and the
beauty of Naples. Alas! these letters would never be
opened by the hand she loved, nor perused by the eyes
she wrote them for!</p>

<p>It was near the close of a glorious day, when the orb
of light was half-sunk in the embrace of the ocean, that
the Countess half sat, half reclined on an ottoman in the
balcony of Villa Reale,&mdash;breathing the soft airs of the
Mediterranean, and gazing with delight on the lovely
scene. Behind her stood the Earl; but it was not on
the scene he gazed, so much as on his partner, in his
eyes,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The fairest still where all was fair."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He thought he had never seen her look half so beautiful
as on that evening; it was not only the passing loveliness
of every feature, nor the grace of every movement,
but the soul, the burning intellect that was shrined on
her white, broad brow,&mdash;which proved how far she excelled
in mind her own beauty, as her beauty excelled
many another fair being. The Countess was dressed in
a light Indian muslin; over her shoulders was thrown a
black lace scarf, and her luxuriant hair was confined, as
usual, in a frail net, which, with its glossy burden, fell
half-way down her back. She rested her cheek on her
symmetrically-formed hand; on her fingers shone the
plain circle of gold, which told her rank as the wife of
him who doated on her, and the ring which she often
playfully told the Earl she regarded even with more tenderness
than her wedding-ring! Her eye was intently
fixed on the west,&mdash;there her mind seemed to be also;
yet, without being able to explain the paradox, her heart
was with him who stood beside her! The sunset was
one which northern climes never own,&mdash;which northern
nations may have dreamed of, but have never seen. It
beggared the very powers of description! Those whose
eyes have been blessed with such sights must feel how
dimly words catch the hues no painter's pencil can fix
on canvas. The last tip of the slowly-sinking sun
seemed to pause for an instant over the waves, as if unwilling
to leave his beloved land to darkness; a broad
path of glory glittered along the dancing wavelets,&mdash;like
a golden highway from earth to heaven; on either side
the waters slept intensely blue, for it was only in the rays
that the eye could discern any motion in the sea. A
felucca craft was slowly rowed across this blaze of light;
its white sails seemed like ebony,&mdash;every part was cut out
black,&mdash;every rope well defined against the glowing background.
Around and above the setting orb the scene was
still more wonderful,&mdash;not a cloud sullied the serene of
heaven, which yet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Of all colours seemed to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Melted to one vast iris of the West."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Each hue was so blended and intermingled from the
golden sun&mdash;so bright&mdash;that the last segment dazzled the
eye,&mdash;to the dark blue sky above, and the indigo of the
east, where the moon rose round and full, that it was
impossible to detect the exact point where the one
ended and the next began, or to conceive how, and where
the rosy warmth of sunset mingled, and melted away
into the cold, clear light of the moon. One star, first of
the daughters of night, shone like a spark of silver in the
crimson depths of air over the west; and if the seaward
view was thus glorious, not less so was the land. Behind
rose olive groves, with their dark-grey foliage, which surrounded
Villa Reale, standing on a slight eminence
about midway between Naples and Portici. To the right
slumbered the white palaces of Napoli la Bella, with their
green Venetian blinds, and St. Elmo, rising like the
guardian of the fair city below. Beyond the northern
horn of the Bay of Naples, Ischia's isle stood out at sea,
bathed in living green light; to the left, behind the villa,
rose Vesuvius, from whose summit wreathed a lazy pillar
of smoke, bent landwards by the faint sea breeze. Still
further, the southern horn, with the white houses of Castellamare
and Sorrento, like pearls scattered on green
moss; and further still, Capri, surrounded by dark waters,&mdash;a
favourite resort in summer for the listless Neapolitans.</p>

<p>On such a scene gazed the Countess; the rosy light of
sunset shed a soft, glowing warmth of colour on her fair
cheek, which heightened the beauty of her complexion.
The balcony, on which the favoured pair enjoyed this
rare evening, was raised some twelve feet above the
orange and lemon groves below; through the trellised-work
of the pillars that supported its roof, vines were
gracefully twined, and hung in easy, inartificial festoons
from above; the floor was formed of tesselated marble;
in the centre was a table of pietra dura, on which were
placed fruit&mdash;vases of flowers&mdash;amphoras containing wines
of the country&mdash;a volume or two of poetry&mdash;the Leghorn
straw hat and white feather, which the lady of the bower
had found too warm, and laid aside.</p>

<p>"Ellen, darling, you look sad,&mdash;what melancholy
thoughts can an evening like this induce?"</p>

<p>"I am not sad, Wentworth; but there is always a sort
of 'sweet dejection' in evenings like this; and when I
see the sun set I sometimes think, how different is nature
from man! How many days of grief and joy have gone
down that same western bourne! Bright days like this
now declining, dark days of storm and tempest; no trace
is left there,&mdash;it is still as blue&mdash;as bright! But how different
with man; when his sun sets there is no morrow&mdash;when
our joys and lights sink, they leave sad shades
behind. Evening always reminds me of death, and this
makes me look grave, perhaps,&mdash;though it is not my own
death, but the death of those I love that I fear."</p>

<p>The Earl had meantime seated himself by his young
wife; taking her free hand, he pressed it fondly to his
lips, exclaiming, "Ellen, I never saw you look so lovely
as to-night!"</p>

<p>"And how fleeting are earth's beauties! I might say
the same of you, love,&mdash;for never did you look fonder, or
seem more loveable. But see how fast the glory of that
sunset is fading; even while I speak every hue glows ere
it dies,&mdash;'The last still loveliest, till&mdash;'tis gone, and all
is grey,'&mdash;as the poet says. And so we shall fade, Wentworth.
All the light on the cheek of beauty is as unreal
and fleeting; and unless we have that within us which
will burn brighter, like yon evening star, when all earthly
delights wax dimmer, what will all avail?"</p>

<p>"You speak like an angel, darling! Ah! look at that
star. I love it more than any other, because I think it
now looks on the western isles,&mdash;our home!"</p>

<p>"Yes, our home,&mdash;where all near and dear to us are
now;&mdash;where Edith is. Oh! sometimes I wish I could
follow that setting sun with you, and see their dear faces
again. I do not know what makes me think so much of
Edith. I sometimes think the spirits of our dearest
friends can follow us, and it seems as if she was now beside
us."</p>

<p>"You superstitious little thing!&mdash;don't you know,
Nelly, the Scotch say, 'It's no canny to talk always of
one person,' and, 'that ill comes of it.'"</p>

<p>"You have expressed exactly my thoughts; I wish I
could think less of her, not that I would wish to love
her less, or could do so; but when memory obtrudes her
at all seasons, I seem to have a strange presentiment all
is not well. Have you never observed, before we lose
any of our friends, we seem to have a peculiar tenderness
for them? It was so before George died,&mdash;on the very
day I thought so much of him! I wish I could banish
the thought, but I cannot. Dear Edith! how affectionately
she bade me farewell! I see her yet on the doorstep,
straining her eyes as if to take her last look! Oh,
Wentworth, I have a dreadful misgiving! God grant it
may be false!"</p>

<p>"Well, Nelly, I never thought you were so superstitious.
To-night I expect the mails, and we shall hear, I
am sure, that Edith is as well as you."</p>

<p>At this moment an Italian servant entered, and apologising
for his intrusion, said there was an Inglese who
wished to see my lord.</p>

<p>"An Englishman! who on earth can it be?" said the
Earl starting up; "ten to one it is Frank on his way to
Corfu. Stay here, darling, and I will be back in a
minute."</p>

<p>The Earl hastened down stairs, expecting to see his
brother; he was somewhat surprised to see young Wilton
instead; there was something, too, in his look which did
not altogether satisfy him.</p>

<p>"Wilton! why, what on earth has brought you here?
Nothing wrong I hope?"</p>

<p>Without replying the young man handed a letter with
a deep black border and black seal to the Earl.</p>

<p>"Now God help me, nothing bad I trust!" he exclaimed,
but his looks belied his words, and his hand so
shook he could hardly open the letter. When at last
he broke the seal and read the fatal announcement he
almost fell, but staggering backwards he seated himself
on a chair, and pressed his hands to his brow. "Oh
my God!" he cried, "this will kill Ellen! Oh Edith&mdash;poor
Edith, and you are gone, and by such a death!
Oh Edith! But I must bear up, I must break this as
I best can to Ellen." Calling all his resolution to restrain
his feelings, he said to Wilton, "Order a travelling
carriage as quickly as possible, and tell Pierre to be
packed in a couple of hours; I start to-night for England.
Ah Wilton! you are bearer of sad tidings."</p>

<p>"I am indeed, my Lord, and grieved am I to my
heart that it fell to me to carry them!"</p>

<p>"I believe you, my trusty servant; but you are fatigued
and hungry doubtless, get something to eat. Shall
you be able to start again in two hours?"</p>

<p>"Ay, my Lord, night and day to serve you."</p>

<p>The Earl then slowly resought his wife; he was many
minutes ascending the few steps that led to the balcony,
turning over in his mind how he should break the news.
But bad news cannot be broken, the instant he re-appeared
Ellen saw something was wrong. "Oh Wentworth,
what is it? something has happened I am sure!" she exclaimed
as she rushed to meet him.</p>

<p>"Edith has been ill, is not expect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell me the worst, hide not anything from me&mdash;is
she gone?"</p>

<p>"She is!"</p>

<p>"I knew it,&mdash;I knew it. Oh Edith my sister! and did
you die, and I wasn't there to take a last embrace? Oh
Edith!" and she sank on her lord's breast, and wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>In two hours the Earl and Countess started for England;
after the first burst of grief, Ellen had become
wonderfully resigned, and resolved to bear up for her
husband's sake. She was dreadfully shocked when she
heard the full particulars of her cruel fate, but she sorrowed
not without hope, believing Edith rested on the
Rock of Ages. Her last walk with her had fully shown
her high principles, and perhaps it was her seeming preparedness
that first gave rise to the presentiment too
sadly realized. After a long and tedious journey they
at length reached the Towers, now saddened by associations
of the past. Every walk, every room, every tree,
seemed fraught with memories of the lost one, and Ellen
found by sad experience there is no rank too high for
pain, suffering, and death. How different was their setting
out and their coming back! But they were united
for weal and woe, for sickness and for health, and if
sorrow had followed soon on joy&mdash;it was sent as a reminder
that here they had no abiding city, and to wean
them from the fleeting pleasures of earth to the fixed
eternal joys above.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter we must glance on the
parting scene of one who has played a conspicuous part
in this story. In a large well-furnished chamber of a
house near the sea at Hamburgh, Juana Ferraras, or
Antonia Stacy as we first knew her, lay on her death
bed. The shades of evening were falling, the close of a
cold frosty day, the fog lay thick on the waters, and the
room was fast darkening like her who lay dying within
it. Near her bed sat old Stacy; he was sobered and
silenced by the approach of death to one, who if he
loved mortal being, was object of that love. Rough as
his features were, they looked softened that night; hard
as his heart was, it seemed flesh again that night! A
rustle was heard in the bed, he looked to see if his
patient wanted anything. The dying girl sat up, death
had nigh done its work, her face was haggard, pale,
and wan; her eyes alone survived the wreck of loveliness,
and seemed brighter and more gloriously dark than ever.</p>

<p>"Bring me my child, let me look my last on that
pledge of lost love."</p>

<p>Old Bill slided away up the stairs, or as he called
them the companion ladder, and hailed a German girl,
who soon appeared with an infant child perhaps two
months old; she was a fine, bright little girl, with eyes
like her mother's, whilst her other features bore some resemblance
to those of the De Veres. She presented a
strange contrast to her dying parent, as she stretched
forth her little arms to her mother. A sad smile lit for
a moment Juana's face as she received her in her arms,
and pressed her to her bosom&mdash;"Farewell, my baby, who
will take care of thee when thy mother is laid low?
Will thy father ever see his child? farewell, my babe,
thou wilt never know a mother's care! She will soon
be gone&mdash;her last thought was of him who gave thee
thy existence! I am sinking&mdash;take her away, Stacy; be
kind to my child for my sake."</p>

<p>"Cuss me if I won't, Tony. Never mind, old girl, you
have had a short and rough cruise, you are nigh port
now."</p>

<p>"I would I were near that haven of rest&mdash;may the
blessed Virgin keep my soul&mdash;oh! my child, my child,
it is hard to leave it. If you ever see my lord give him
my child&mdash;tell him I died blessing him!"</p>

<p>"Why shiver my timbers, Tony, if my glimmers haint
sprung a leak," said the old man, brushing away his
tears with his rough pilot jacket sleeve; "I calculated I
had done with tears, but the tanks ain't pumped dry
yet."</p>

<p>"I am dying,&mdash;I feel the tooth of death at my heart.
Oh! Santissima Maria! this pain&mdash;it tortures me, it
gnaws my very vitals. Oh! that I could die."</p>

<p>"Cheer up, old gal, many a bark's ridden through a
worser storm; ye'll come it yet may be."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;the room grows dark&mdash;oh, it is come at last,
God bless my child&mdash;and Wentworth. God bless *  *,"
with these words she sank back and expired.</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if she haint&mdash;ay, ay, she's gone sure
enough now&mdash;weighed anchor and cleared off, and left old
Bill alone. Split my wig if I b'aint sorry&mdash;she did
peach once&mdash;but never heed, she loved him more than
he deserved! She is gone now, rest her soul, and her
faults. Gad, if old Don Ramond seed her now&mdash;it were
hard lines for her. I guess she mout have sailed over
broad lands t'other side o' the Atlantic, heir to many a
league, but all's up now. Consarn me if I don't care for
your bit child,&mdash;God rest you, Tony, you are in port
now."</p>

<p>With these words the old smuggler and pirate walked
off to see about her interment. "It is strange," he said
to himself, "ever since she seed the Captain she has
drooped; she was a fine creature, I'm blessed if she
warn't! If I thought&mdash;but no, bad as he is he couldn't
hardly! If he had though, he'd better see hisself well
away&mdash;he'd better give a wide berth to old Bill Stacy&mdash;the
world warn't sea room enough, but I'd overhaul the
devil, wi' his black heart."</p>

</div></div>


<p>From his earliest years the Captain had given evidence
of those evil desires and bold licentious passions which
his manlier years had fully developed. "The child is
father to the man," is one of the truest proverbs, and in
John de Vere's case its truth was wonderfully exemplified.
The petulance of childhood had strengthened into
ungovernable passion; the desire for self-gratification
had swelled into unrestrained pleasure-seeking, combined
with great selfishness, which cared not how it injured
another, provided it gratified its own wishes. Every other
childish failing had grown into enormities of vice, even
as the letting out of water, small as the stream may at
first seem, increases into the turbulent and maddened
torrent that carries everything before its headlong current.
From a child he had evinced that cruelty of disposition
which, though at first it only exercised itself on
the meaner creatures, whose tortures gave the young
Domitian pleasure, now that childish days were gone,
the same increased to a fearful extent on his fellow
creatures. He who as a child shuddered not at the
sufferings of a fly, a bird, or even a cat baited by
dogs, now shuddered not at the death of a man by sword
or bullet, or the sufferings of a woman carried off to
gratify his friend, and perhaps got rid of with the
same amount of feeling with which he would kick a dog
from his door, or slaughter the hound that had ceased to
earn his compassion. When as a boy John de Vere
amused himself at his home, bird-nesting, cat-baiting,
rat-hunting, even cock fights, were a great pleasure.
Many of the tenants and retainers at the Towers remembered
how John began by glueing walnut shells filled
with pitch on the paws of the housekeeper's favourite
Tomcat, and ended by tying him on a goose's back and
setting them off together on the lake, enjoying the sight
of the cat tearing the bird's back with his long claws,
and the bird diving to drown her rapacious enemy.
Every kind of cruelty, from spinning cockchafers on a
pin, and turning birds plucked of their feathers alive
into the woods, to the worse scenes of the cockpit and
badger baiting, amused him till he became ten years
old, or thereabout, when he was sent to Harrow. Naturally
of a depraved character, it was his own bad
heart that suggested these crimes, and not bad example,
for his elder brother, the Earl, had none of these tastes
but spent his time shooting or riding, and gained the
character of a famous sportsman in all the neighbourhood.
The old Earl, who lived till John was thirteen or
fourteen, was often told of these early signs of depravity,
but would only call him a "sad fellow," a "naughty,
cruel boy," and "he would grow wiser when he got
older." Augusta too used to speak often to him, but he
was of that age when boys generally despise the other
sex, and not only turned a deaf ear to her admonitions,
but called her a silly, chicken-hearted girl, and said that
men never thought of such things. If his father went
fox-hunting, why should he not hunt cats? When John
went to Harrow, he soon became the leader and chieftain
of a set of boys as bad as himself. He was, however,
obliged to fag, and his master happened to be the
Marquis of Arranmore, then Earl of Claremont, who
was an easy-going, good-natured sort of fellow, and
though he once or twice gave him a hiding, was on the
whole a very merciful lord. Young Musgrave was also
a boy at Harrow; and these two, equally bad, Musgrave
in the scheming and John in the acting part of their
juvenile scrapes, were the chosen leaders in every row.
If there was an orchard robbed, windows broken, farmers'
fields trampled over&mdash;the head offender was John de
Vere; the planner of the action, Musgrave. From
Harrow, Musgrave and John de Vere went to a military
college to prepare for the army, and here they set out
on a bolder line. The theatre and saloon were their
nightly rendezvous, and men of wicked character their
companions in idle hours. Occasionally they took excursions
to town, and flew with avidity to every kind of
vicious pleasure. They then entered the 7th
Hussars together, into which regiment L'Estrange exchanged;
and the three young men soon became prime
leaders in every folly and dissipation, then more common
than now. Their colonel, Sir Harry Maynard, overlooked
many a breach of military discipline in consideration
of youth and inexperience; possibly the well-filled
purse of the young officer De Vere, his excellent champagne
suppers, &amp;c., made a balance in favour of him and
his friend with the regiment, or assuredly their names
would have been erased. Owing to the 7th being quartered
at Brighton some time, the Prince Regent became
acquainted with young De Vere, and finding him suited
to his mind in every way, he made strides in Royal
favour, as well from the fact of his brother, the Earl,
holding a high position at Court, as from his qualities corresponding
with alas! the known character of the Prince.
It was in a row at Brighton, in which both Musgrave
and De Vere played a notable part, that the latter first
became known to Bill Stacy, and this strange, dark
character appeared to take peculiar pleasure in his new
acquaintance, as well as to evince such a knowledge
of the noble family of which he was a scion, as often to
make the Captain open his eyes with astonishment, and
wonder who upon earth old Bill could be, and where he
had gleaned his information. The old desperado, however,
showed himself fully capable of holding his own
secrets, and after trying by threats and entreaties, and
plying Bill drunk and sober to get at the bottom, he
gave it up as a bad job, but continued the acquaintance,
as Bill was a fit instrument for many of his designs. The
foregoing chapters have fully proved the service Bill
afforded to this bad young man, over whose early life we
have glanced merely to show the reader that he was
naturally demoralized, and had grown in <i>dis</i>favour with
God and man from his youth up. It only now remains
to resume the thread of the Captain's history at the
point where we last lost sight of him, and bring it on to
the next point, where his fortunes mingle with others
connected with our tale.</p>

<p>When Captain De Vere and Scroop left the Towers,
on the fatal evening of the duel, they proceeded straight
to Leith, whence Archy was sent back with the horses,
while our two friends proceeded to embark, having first
routed out old Stacy, who had returned from Germany,
after leaving L'Estrange at Hamburgh. Bill was right
glad to see the Captain again, and he soon found a bark
ready to convey them to Hamburgh also. In this ship
high words passed between the Captain and Juana, who
was also a passenger; however, ere they reached Germany,
they appeared entirely to have made it up,
though it was a matter not unobserved by several that
from that day Juana gradually drooped, until she ended
her life as we have seen in the last chapter. At Hamburgh
the Captain soon discovered his old friend
L'Estrange, and so close did their intimacy again become
that Scroop, who was entirely ignorant of the true facts
of the abduction, expressed his surprise at the Captain's
having any doings with him. This was the first seed
of dislike betwixt the two, and ended in an encounter
between the late principal and second, in which the
latter was so badly cut by his antagonist&mdash;for they fought
with rapiers&mdash;that his life was despaired of.</p>

<p>The Captain and L'Estrange, who assumed the name
of Count Czinsky, were fain to leave for St. Petersburgh,
not however before the former wrung a promise from
the wounded man he would never mention the fact of
his meeting L'Estrange again, should he survive and
return home. At St. Petersburgh our duo kept up the
greatest style, and created quite a sensation amongst
the fair Russian ladies.</p>

<p>One day L'Estrange opened an English newspaper, in
which was a full account of the Earl's marriage.</p>

<p>"She is married," he cried, "she is married!" dropping
the paper from his hands.</p>

<p>"Of course you didn't think the Earl was fool enough
to wait till you played the part of young Lochinvar
again, and ran off with his Ellen. Why, Ned, you are
a greater fool than I took you for! Egad, it sits sore
does it, Ned? Take my advice and snap your fingers at
a girl who won't take you.&mdash;I'll read the account for
you&mdash;give me the paper, old Spooniana! Why, pest,
after all it is as bad for me as you. I lose my coronet&mdash;and
you your lady love!" so saying he took the papers
and read the article aloud, laughing&mdash;then tossed it to
L'Estrange again. The latter began to read over the
sad paragraph, with that earnestness with which we often
read again and again what is the most painful to our
feelings. At last he cried out, "Here's something for
you&mdash;let's see how you bear ill news, who are so ready
to read them to others."</p>

<p>"Read away, read away&mdash;it's not a little will make
my face as long as yours is, Ned! Why, God a'
mercy, you look as if you were going to be hung; fire
away with your evil reports!"</p>

<p>"'After the departure of the noble Earl and his lovely
partner,' (oh! that I should read it)," read L'Estrange&mdash;"'the
Marquis of Arranmore kept open house at
the Castle, and was to end the festivities of the week by
a grand flare up, which festive event was suddenly prevented
by a melancholy and fatal accident, by which
the young and elegant Marchioness lost her life.'"</p>

<p>"Heavens!" muttered the Captain.</p>

<p>"'It may be remembered that only a year ago this
lady, eldest sister of the Earl of Wentworth, was married
to the noble Marquis&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Read ahead!" cried the Captain.</p>

<p>"'A few moments before the ball commenced the
attention of the Marquis and Mr. Lennox, then staying
at the Towers, was drawn to the lady's room by screams
of a most harrowing nature, and the unhappy young
lady appeared enveloped in flames, which were, however,
speedily extinguished, but not before the unfortunate
Marchioness had sustained such injuries as proved fatal.
A short time before midnight death ended her sufferings.'"</p>

<p>"Egad, that was a <i>flare up</i>! The Marquis never
dreamed of that, I'll warrant!" said the heartless man.</p>

<p>"De Vere," said L'Estrange, horrified at this unfeeling
jest, "your cold-blooded ferocity makes my blood curdle.
What have you come to when you joke on your sister's
lamentable death?"</p>

<p>"By Jove! you take me up sharply. On my soul I
am sorry, d&mdash;d sorry&mdash;poor Edith! I am awfully cut up
about her. As I live I meant not what I said. Come,
Ned, don't look so savage! Come, and we'll have a
bottle of wine, and drown this horrid remembrance.
Egad! I am awfully sorry, I am sure I would it had been
any one else! Come, Ned, I didn't mean anything,
only it came so pat!"</p>

<p>And with these words he actually dismissed his
sister's death, and to drown his sorrow plunged into
every kind of dissipation for the next three months,
until he made St. Petersburgh too hot for himself by
shooting Count Strogonoff in an affair of honour, and
probably saved ending his days in Siberian mines by a
speedy escape in sleighs through Poland to Germany,
where he and L'Estrange spent the summer at Baden-Baden,
which was even then notorious as a gambling-place.
Here the Captain had a run of luck at the
roulette-tables, and pocketed an almost incredible amount.
Many a hapless gambler was ruined by him, and on
one occasion when he had won every farthing from a
luckless Baron, the unfortunate loser blew his brains out
over the table!</p>

<p>"Kelner, wipe up that mess," said the Captain, with
a sneer. "I wish to G&mdash; people would blow out their
brains in their own houses, and not choose the saloons
for such purposes!"<a name="FNanchor_B_" id="FNanchor_B_"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_" title="A fact." class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>These two associates in evil soon made Baden too hot
for them also, and travelled about till they again reached
Hamburgh, where Bill met them with important news
from England. After a long conversation with L'Estrange,
whose conscience was getting more and more
seared from his intercourse with such a reprobate, they
both set sail for Scotland, taking Stacy with them. It
was then about the middle of December, a time when
Christmas festivities are in preparation&mdash;those at the
Towers would be of the most private character&mdash;and the
Captain spoke of showing his face again at home, thinking
the duel would be pretty well blown over; however,
the large debts he had incurred both in Scotland and
England would not so easily be forgotten, and he determined
he would not risk incarceration in Fleet Street
Prison again, for he had once tasted its joys, until
released by the Earl's paying off his liabilities. These,
however, had now reached a pass which the Earl would
probably be unable, even if willing to defray. The coming
of these birds of ill omen so near the home of the
Countess seems to bode no good, but we must leave the
result to another chapter.</p>

<p>On a dark night in December&mdash;stormy as that eve on
which Leander swam for the last time across the broad
Hellespont&mdash;a small lugger manfully breasting the billows
ran ashore near Musselburgh. There was a high north-easter,
driving sleet and snow before it, and raising a
heavy surf, through which old Bill skilfully ran his
craft ashore on the sandy, seaweedy, mussel-beds, whence
the burgh takes its name.</p>

<p>"Have a care, you scurvy old devil," cried the Captain,
as a huge sea broke over the side of the boat, and
christened him with its salt spray&mdash;"Easy there&mdash;where
is your seamanship gone? Egad, I'm drenched like a
water rat."</p>

<p>"When you've sailed as far as me&mdash;you won't swear at
a bit dusting like that&mdash;you are but a land-lubber
after all!"</p>

<p>"Stow your venom, you old dogfish, and give us a
dram. Ah! here comes another sea over these accursed
sands! Ho! well done, Bill; she wore off like
a gull: jump out, Ned, never mind wetting your boots.
Easy, ho! down with the sail, here we go&mdash;ashore at
last."</p>

<p>So saying he leaped into the water up to his knees
after L'Estrange, and these two on one side, with old
Bill and a German boy on the other, shoved up the
smack high and dry.</p>

<p>"Well, let those like the sea who do&mdash;terra firma for
me," cried the Captain, shaking the sea-water off his
waterproof cloak. "'The white waves heaving high' be
d&mdash;d! such a pitching and lurching as we've had&mdash;I am
right glad to stand on something solid, arn't you, old
fellow?"</p>

<p>"I am indeed&mdash;and glad to stretch my limbs&mdash;so miserably
cooped up this last five hours! what an age
it is since I last trod these sands! Oh! could I see
how this will turn out!"</p>

<p>"Where do you steer for now, and where am I to
moor myself? Leastways, not here, if I knows it! for
it is rascally cold&mdash;we'd best run down after a boosing
ken."</p>

<p>"You are for swilling, no doubt, Bill&mdash;you drunken
old satyr&mdash;always up to filling your barrel-shaped body
with liquor! but look you, Bill, we haven't come all
this way to lush. I must be off to the Towers. Blow
this climate, it's always sleeting and raining in this
rotten hole! You and I, L'Estrange, will go and meet
Archy, he will have the nags ready; and you, old sot,
you may go and be d&mdash;d, or swig, or what you like, only
be here by the time tide is full, and leave Hans (the
boy) to watch over the boat. Give him some grog&mdash;for
it is infernally cold! Come, Ned."</p>

<p>The Captain and L'Estrange walked off and left old
Bill to find a pump, whilst the unfortunate foreigner
was left to watch in the sleet and wind which blew most
chillily over the Links.</p>

<p>"This is a regular wild goose chase," said the Captain,
as he and his friend struck out for a small village called
Fisherrow, a bleak hamlet between Musselburgh and
Portobello, where Archy was to be in waiting with
horses; "and I only do it as a last hope&mdash;you must
make up your mind for a failure&mdash;and then remember
you are never to speak of the wench again&mdash;that was
the promise."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;oh! how my heart seems to sink&mdash;in a few
hours more I shall know my fate!"</p>

<p>"You will&mdash;and I am thankful for it. Your whining
and teasing after that woman are enough to drive a
saint mad! On my soul I wonder at you&mdash;I dare
swear she has never thought of you once! Then
there's her child, whatever are we to do with that, supposing
our plan succeeds? To be sure it's easy giving it
a heave into the sea! But yet it is an awful risk!
Carrying off Ellen Ravensworth was one thing, but
carrying off the Countess of Wentworth is another!
Never mind&mdash;nothing like aiming high, as Lucifer
once did."</p>

<p>"And got a grievous fall for his pains too," put in
L'Estrange.</p>

<p>"As we perhaps, nay doubtless, shall!" said the
Captain.</p>

<p>"Had we not better think again? it is not too late
yet," said L'Estrange.</p>

<p>"It is too late; I haven't come all this way, nor
been tossed on that rough sea for nothing! I tell you,
however, I shall go and see only; if what we heard is
true and she is alone, it is but a whistle and you come
up, toss her over a nag, brain any flunkeys who interfere,
and away over heath and moor to the boatie good!
The sea is a road where it is hard to track a cunning fox
like Bill."</p>

<p>"I almost repent I ever came&mdash;after all if she did
nothing but cry and lament, I could do nothing. Remember
what I said, I will try by words, and if she
doesn't come round again, I will take her back
scathless."</p>

<p>"A fool's errand that&mdash;you may do what you like
after you have got her. I will be shot if I burn my
fingers again for her, or any other woman under the sun!
But here we are at last&mdash;I will whistle."</p>

<p>The Captain&mdash;for though he no longer had a right
to the name, we still know him best by it&mdash;then blew a
shrill whistle. It was answered, and presently Archy
Forbes appeared.</p>

<p>"Glad to see ye baith looking sae weel&mdash;it's ay a saft
night when we are about."</p>

<p>"It is, Archy my boy! it's easy to see Heaven doesn't
smile on us&mdash;but devil's weather for me! Have you the
nags?"</p>

<p>"Surely, surely&mdash;they are in yon byre&mdash;follow me."</p>

<p>"Who are at the Towers, Archy?" said L'Estrange.</p>

<p>"Dinna speer on me, sir! I have na been there this
mony a day. Sin my father was dead and gane&mdash;Heaven
rest him! the gear a' went wrang, and my mither
and the bairns left. The laird wasna pleased, and
folk say he kent mair than was right anent your
honour's business, and thae&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace, fool, who wants to hear about your concerns?
If you had found out who were at the Towers you
might have been somewhat worth listening to. Where
is this byre, or what d'you call it?"</p>

<p>"It's near by noo, yon dark house, wi' the reek frae
the chimla."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;there's your hire&mdash;and now decamp and
find out old Bill, and tell him to put the cabin in order
for fair freight."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached a wretched stable, or
rather cow-house, from which two tolerable horses were
produced. The Captain, selecting the best, was soon
mounted, and together they trotted off for the Towers.
During the long ride scarcely a word was spoken, except
now and then a hoarse curse on the snow, which now
began falling thick and fast, and balled in their horses
hoofs, forcing them to dismount several times on their
way. When within a quarter of a mile of the Towers
they stopped at a summer-house or arbour, where
L'Estrange was to await the result of the Captain's reconnaissance,
and if summoned by the whistle ride up at
once to the Towers. This bold and diabolic attempt
had been undertaken, owing to a statement which had
reached the Captain to the effect that the Countess and
her infant baby, a fine little girl of nearly three months
of age, were then staying in perfect seclusion at the
Towers, and the Earl in London on business. Judging
themselves able to overcome old Andrew, and any other
footmen, they fancied they could get clear off with the
lady and her child before any of the out-door servants
took the alarm, and then their determination was to set
sail for the north of Scotland, where L'Estrange madly
dreamed he could excite the old love by his eloquence
of woe. He vowed he would restore her safely to her
home again should he fail, and then fly to America and
bury himself from the world. The Captain took part in
the plot, and promised his assistance if the little girl was
also carried off&mdash;Bill was to take care and keep her out
of sight, living or dead&mdash;and we are authorized in stating
that though he verbally approved of L'Estrange's plan
of returning the Countess, unless she chose to stay with
him,&mdash;an idea that could only take its birth in a mind
maddened by a strange delusion,&mdash;yet he inly determined,
if he once got hold of both he would keep them out
of sight until he could gain a heavy ransom from his
brother; for his violent deeds seemed to have excluded
all hopes of his ever succeeding to the title even if he
got rid of the heirs.</p>

<p>Leaving L'Estrange at the arbour, the Captain wrapped
himself up in a costly cloak of sable fur, and rode for
the Towers, which he reached a little past ten in the
evening. The brilliant lights first excited his fears that
the rumour was a false one; however, he rang the bell
and waited to see the result. Whilst he is waiting we
will take a view of the dining-room and its inmates.
About a dozen gentlemen are sitting over their wine
after dinner. The Earl at the head of the table&mdash;next
him the Marquis&mdash;all the rest are strangers but two,
young Scroop and Mr. Lennox.</p>

<p>"I wonder what has become of the Captain?" said
the Earl; "except these scandals, which I hope are
worthless, we never hear a word of him, or his
friend."</p>

<p>"Their names," said the Marquis, "are, I fear,
famous for infamy; while John kept to a few harmless
revels, and only now and then an affair <i>d'honneur</i>, I
didn't care; but shooting fellows at every town, is too
wild by half!"</p>

<p>At the same moment the door opened, and a tall
figure, so muffled in fur as to be almost irrecognizable,
entered. Old Andrew appeared giggling behind.</p>

<p>"Hallo! old fellows," said the figure, throwing off
his cloak; "here I am again. By Jove! this snug
room, and these merry fellows make me feel jolly.
Andrew, you knave, get some hot punch, blest if I
am not half frozen&mdash;I will thaw anon and welcome old
friends, wait till I have got some life in me," approaching
the fire.</p>

<p>Old Andrew, grinning with joy, hastened to get the
punch as he knew the Captain liked it, whilst all his old
allies gathered round him, and beset him with questions
on all sides.</p>

<p>"Preserve me from my friends; why, you will be
driving me into the fire, and one in a family is enough for
it. Egad, I am thawing now: how are you, Wentworth,
hearty, and you Arranmore, old boy? I was very sorry
for poor dear Edith; how the devil did she go and
manage to get burned? ah, I see you are still tender
about it; never mind, time will cure you of the burn.
And you, Scroop: ha! bless my soul, I am gladder to see
you well than any; shake hands, old fellow, no malice.
And you, Lennox; by Jove, this reminds me of old times.
Where's Johnny Ravensworth?"</p>

<p>"He is at Sandhurst, preparing for the line. My
father-in-law has succeeded to a nice little property in
the Highlands, and Ellen&mdash;you havn't asked me about my
wife."</p>

<p>"Egad, I quite forgot her. I'll warrant her flourishing
from your face;&mdash;and your little boy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, little girl; it was rather a disappointment,
but she is a darling child."</p>

<p>"Never mind, better luck next time; do you not
think so, Wentworth? Come, let us sit down and hear
about all my friends. Ha, Scott, I thought I knew you;
and Trevors too,&mdash;keen after the hounds as ever, squire?"</p>

<p>"As ever, but this weather is bad for us, it's like snow,
I fear."</p>

<p>"Like it; it is snowing like fury now. Egad it was
balling in avalanches on my nag's hoofs."</p>

<p>"Oh, you rode then?" said the Earl.</p>

<p>"I didn't exactly walk, as my boots and spurs might
have told you, but where I came from I won't say; the
fox doesn't show where it earths, and I mustn't show my
face by aught than lamplight."</p>

<p>"Then I fear your evil reports are true,&mdash;you have
been making the Continent too hot for you."</p>

<p>"My evil reports,&mdash;if you mean by that my duels,&mdash;are
certainly not few and far between; but it isn't my fault,
if those rascally foreigners will quarrel so. Egad, they
will find one Englishman a match for twenty of their
cowardly selves. I'll whip them into order. But it is
sheriff's officers that I fear here, and when I've had my
grog, and seen the girls, I must put a dozen miles
between us."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that; but remember the Towers are
safe, no sheriff's officer puts his head in here."</p>

<p>"I know that, but then I have a friend waiting&mdash;Czinsky."
Scroop looked uneasy.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you bring him here?" said the Earl.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't come; he's waiting a dozen miles from
this, and I must soon be off."</p>

<p>"Stay, we can send. Do rest a day or two," said the
Earl.</p>

<p>"No use pressing, I can't. I don't mean to be rude,
only God knows I can't stop. Ring the bell, Lennox,
please; what is that stupid villain Andrew about?"</p>

<p>"Here, Captain, here; het, strang, and sweet, isna that
your song? an' how are ye? weel to dae?" said the old
servant, bringing in a large bowl of smoking punch.</p>

<p>"Egad, this is the stuff on a snowy night. It's always
snowing here it seems. Do you remember the night I
hooked it, after nailing Musgrave, poor devil&mdash;I hope he
was decently interred. By Jove, I was very sorry I hit
him where I did; he was a good fellow, and here's to his
health, and yours, Scroop; and as you love me don't
quarrel."</p>

<p>"If little quarrels make great friends, sharp cuts make
blunt ones. Why you drive your rapier through and
through a fellow, like a spit through a partridge, and
then talk of being good friends again! however, I will
drink your health, and the further we fly the tighter we'll
tie! I've had enough of close friendship with you."</p>

<p>"Come, I believe you are angry after all. Never
mind, <i>chacun &agrave; son go&ucirc;t</i>, nothing like being on good
terms with the man that eats you. Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>After emptying another bowl with the Marquis and
one or two others who remained behind to hear the
Captain's adventures, whilst the Earl, who didn't exactly
like to ally himself again with such a scapegrace, and the
remaining guests joined the ladies, the Captain rose,
exclaiming with an oath he must be on his travels. He
however went up stairs to see Lady Florence and the
Countess; the first received him with sisterly warmth of
welcome, whilst the reception he met with from the
latter was cold, and politely frigid in the extreme. He
asked to see the little girl, and was shown by the Countess
and his sister to the next room, where in a handsome
cot the infant slept. Lady Wentworth bent over
it with a mother's love, whilst the Captain looked gloomily
on the little features of her, who at any rate would
cut him out of his prospects. To the question if he
did not think her a lovely child he answered, "Every
baby, he supposed, was thought lovely by its mother;
however, she did seem much above the usual run of
children." He then came back to the drawing-room,
shook hands with those he knew, and departed as
mysteriously as he came. Mr. Lennox and the Marquis
saw him off, and each returned disgusted by his
parting sally. As he shook hands with Lord Arranmore
he observed:</p>

<p>"I say, Arranmore, that flare up you were to give after
the Earl's wedding was one with a vengeance. Egad it
made me laugh in my sorrow for poor Edith."</p>

<p>The Marquis, totally unprepared for such a heartless
jest, drew himself up to his full height, saying:</p>

<p>"De Vere, I never knew you before; henceforth let all
intercourse cease between us. Inhuman vampire, thus
jesting on the death of your sister. I discard your
friendship for ever."</p>

<p>"Nay, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I hear you not," said the Marquis, striding away.</p>

<p>"Well I'm d&mdash;d, that scurvy joke makes every one
so infernally wrath! After all, Lennox, it wasn't a bad
one, was it?"</p>

<p>"Mr. de Vere," said Mr. Lennox.</p>

<p>"Stay, give me my rank, you saucy fool, or by G&mdash;d
I'll lay this whip about you."</p>

<p>"Captain de Vere then, if you like, a word in your
ear; stay, I must speak low," he said, going up to him
close. "It surprises me, sir, you dared to show your
face. I have long suspected you, and lately found out
your share in the abduction; you are here on no good
to-night, and unless you will give me your word you
will again leave these shores before twenty-four hours, I
will tell the Earl my suspicions."</p>

<p>"Hark you, my pert coxcomb, if I did not think it
beneath me to touch such a reptile as you, I would give
you what would shut your mouth up; you may live to
repent this, Mr. Lennox. As for your threats, I heed
them no more than yourself, and you have my full leave
to proclaim your suspicions, but egad you'll suffer, though
I am safe in ten minutes. Who'll track me with the
snow falling like this? Now you may go and be hanged,
and hold your secrets if you are wise."</p>

<p>So saying he rode off in the blinding snow, leaving
Mr. Lennox petrified. He did tell his suspicions to the
Earl, however, and a watch was kept up all that night, as
several others felt perplexed at this singular appearance,
and sudden departure of such a bird of prey. When the
Captain reached the arbour he found L'Estrange
buried in such a reverie his heavy arm only awoke him
from it.</p>

<p>"It is useless then. Oh! my God! I am truly most
ill-starred."</p>

<p>"If you don't want to be manacled and prisoned you
will be up and away; there are a dozen stout fellows at
the Towers, and havn't I just stirred up a wasp's nest,&mdash;we
shall feel their stings if you are not sharp. Confound
the snow-storm, and yet it is a friend in need to-night."</p>

<p>Without another word the two remounted, and rode
off for the beach, where they found the tide had already
floated the craft.</p>

<p>"No fair freight to-night, Bill," said the Captain, "and
now let us be aboard and away; it is well, Bill, you know
the steerage of these seas; in such a storm of snow as this
it is pretty dangerous."</p>

<p>"Never a fear; I can take her through as if the sun
was blazing," said old Bill. "The auld country be
cussed, and hoora for Italy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, hurra for Naples! No such nights as these, Bill.
Come, Ned, what the devil are you dreaming of? Remember
you have done with her. Hurra for sunny
lands, fleet steeds, and bonny black eyes!"</p>

<p>L'Estrange silently took his place in the small lugger.
Hans and old Bill spread the sail, the Captain took the
rudder. After one or two sousers, they got under weigh,
and steered for the schooner, which lay in the Leith
roads, and was ready to carry them to Italy.</p>

<p>Despite the snow, Bill and the Captain sang sea songs,
and drank grog, but vainly attempted to rouse their
sombre companion. He was miserable; he was leaving
Albion for the last time as far as he knew,&mdash;leaving his
country&mdash;leaving his hopes, his fears, his everything. It
was a severe wrench. Bad as he was, he was not like the
Captain, without one redeeming quality; amid all the
vice, guilt, and blackness of his heart, one star shone&mdash;the
brighter in contrast to the darkness around it. The
snow drifted heavily on him, he shook it not off, he felt
it not; a sense of utter sickness and despair was at his
heart: he knew all was his own doing&mdash;he sighed now only
for her <i>friendship</i>, only to see her&mdash;she could not be his
wife now, and he was, by a life of guilt and vice, closing
even that door of hope. How could a creature so
pure, so beautiful, so refined, look on a wretch like him,
so impure, so unholy, so lost to all sense of even shame!
Every hour of his present life was adding another league
to the distance that severed her from him in this life,
as every bound his vessel made was adding another wave
to the many that rolled between them. He wished the
next billow would gulph their frail boat; alas! it rode
them like a seagull, and seemed as if it mocked his
misery and laughed at his woe. He was lost&mdash;not even
the prospect of meeting her above. A gulph&mdash;a great
gulph was fixed between them; she couldn't love him;
he loved her still, though he felt he dared not look up to
her, so vile had he become. He was roused from this
dream by the clanging of the coupling chains, which
showed they had reached the schooner. More dead than
alive he was hoisted up, and soon sails were spread,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And, shrouded as they go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a hurricane of snow,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>they soon made for the open main. When poor
L'Estrange next woke, nothing but waters were around
him, and old England, and all good, all delightful, all
virtuous, left on the lee. He then tried to nerve himself
up; he drank, he swore like the rest, and even joined
in the song&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why so pale and wan, fond lover?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>with its ending lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If of herself she will not love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nothing can make her."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ha! grown wise at last," said the Captain; "'let the
devil take her,' and wine and laughter for us!"</p>

<p>L'Estrange's heart still beat true, and though he
laughed, sang, and seemed after this the gayest of the
gay, all was false. Often, when on his lone couch, on
the lonely billow, his eyes would fill with bitter tears as
he thought on what he was now, and what he had been;
as he thought how sad a contrast his present loveless
wicked life was to that of former years, he would cry
with Byron&mdash;</p>

<p>We turn with pleasure from these dark outlaws to pure
affections in pure bosoms. Johnny Ravensworth was
growing up all that his father could desire; he was full of
the most exhilarant spirits, but had been strictly moral in
his private character, amid all the temptations of a dissipated
military school. He took away such a character
for diligence, good conduct, and steadiness, that the
highest hopes were formed that he would prove an ornament
to the profession he had chosen. His talents, though
not brilliant, were of a high order,&mdash;his attainments were
steady and solid. To these he added the gifts of excellent
good temper, and thorough unselfishness, the main-spring
of all real politeness; for though it often happens
a finished gentleman like the Earl of Chesterfield may be
exceedingly selfish, yet we never find an unselfish man
who has not the principles of true politeness, and is not
a thorough gentleman. It was, therefore, with feelings
of pride and delight that John Ravensworth, as we must
now call him, after passing a severe examination, yet
gaining a high place, bade adieu to his masters, with
whom he was a great favourite, owing to his steady progress
and unimpeachable conduct whilst under their discipline;
and to his fellow students, who lost in him their
captain in all manly amusements; for, while Ravensworth
would never join them in any ungentlemanly, or foolish
expedition, in riding, rowing, cricketing, and all the
healthful and useful accomplishments, he took the lead
that his well-knit frame and unimpaired physical strength
entitled him to hold. Assuredly all who saw him as he
walked forward, amid the plaudits of his fellow companions,
and the waving of fair ladies' kerchiefs, to receive
the gold medal for good conduct, and contrasted
his handsome face, glowing with health and conscious
pride, his manly form proportioned like a young Adonis,
could not but contrast health and vigour of mind
and body, arising from subjecting them to their proper
discipline, with the sallow looks and impaired constitutions
of many of his collegiates, which told too plainly
the ravages of youthful intemperance on unperfected
frames. But who could look for a moment on the bright,
healthful, young Ravensworth, and the dull impoverished
devotee of pleasure, and not see how temperance has
the promise of this life as well as the next? And what
young beauty would not rather gaze on him than on those
poor debilitated companions in learning? Thus, at the
youthful age of eighteen, after having won golden
opinions from every one he was connected with, young
Ravensworth, with a light heart, bade farewell to the
south, and started by coach for the Highlands, in order
to spend a couple of months with his father before
sailing for India, as the regiment to which he was
gazetted was on service at Delhi. The third, and last
month of his leave was promised to his sister at the
Towers, and we must say that in the young soldier's
breast an inmate of those towers claimed a large part.
It was now more than two years since he had seen his
sister or Lady Florence, whose fair face and sunny
tresses had made so deep an impression on his youthful
fancy.</p>

<p>The two months passed away swiftly but pleasantly
among the hills, the valleys, and dark rolling burns
of the North. In rambles with Maude, or riding excursions
with his father over the romantic county of
Perth, the days were fleeting away, and he was able
to have a week's slamming at the grouse ere he bade
adieu to his home. The pangs of parting with his father
and his sister, who was now growing into girlhood verging
on her fourteenth year, were alleviated by two
thoughts,&mdash;the first that he had high hopes of a future
meeting ere long, when he came back with laurels to be
welcomed by his friends and relations as a hero; the
second, that his parting was only the prelude of his meeting
with Ellen, and one, still dearer, of whom he thought
morn, noon, and even; and it was that uncertainty if he
should find her still the same Florence he had left two
years ago&mdash;if he dwelt in her heart as she did in his&mdash;that
made his pulses beat higher. That very uncertainty
which like clouds on a sunny day lend their beauty to
the sky, for without the shades of doubt love would often
lose half its charms. It would be difficult to depict his
feelings as his post-chaise entered the gates, and drove up
the park towards the Towers. The past and the dim
future so possessed his mind he could not but lose sight
of the present. The two years seemed but so many
hours; it was but yesterday he had scampered across that
park, but yet how had those years altered him, and all
his ideas. He was then a careless boy, he was now a
young soldier just entering on the campaign of life.
Burning hopes of high renown, lawful ambition that
pointed on to glory, were his now. In one thing he was
unchanged, in one matter his heart was the same as then&mdash;in
love to Lady Florence. It was then a boyish flame&mdash;time
and absence had deepened it into real attachment.
He had seen much beauty, he had been courted by
fashion, but he had never altered in sentiments to her!
Now he was about to see her again&mdash;would she be the
same to him?&mdash;had time altered her sentiments? No
letter, no message had passed between them all that
time; it would have been presumption in him, it would
have been unmaidenly in her, to have sent such&mdash;that
was nothing. He had hopes; she had often and often,
when he was a boy, declared Johnny only should be her
husband&mdash;that she would never forget him. Ah, how
would it be? how would she receive him now? would it
be with the cold politeness of the world, as if they had
never loved, or with the warm affection of those who
meet to love again?</p>

<p>Whilst these and many such thoughts occupied his
mind, the post-chaise whirled on, and ere he hardly woke
from his reverie it stopped before the arched doorway.
He leaped out, and saw old Andrew, who gazed for a
moment as if he hardly recognized him, and then, with
a beaming face, shook hands, exclaiming&mdash;"God bless
you, Master Johnny, ye are grown a braw sodger noo,
I wad scarce hae kent you."</p>

<p>Delighted at the warm reception even from the faithful
old servant, young Ravensworth hastened up stairs
to the drawing-room, where he found his sister the Countess,
with her infant son in her arms, and her little Edith
Augusta, such was the child's name, prattling at her feet
on the soft Turkey carpet. Ellen's warm heart swelled
with joy when she saw Johnny, a fine soldierly young
man, and as he clasped her in his arms, her eyes filled
with tears of joy, and a sort of bright sorrow as she recollected
how George had thus come home, and then
parted never to come back.</p>

<p>"My dear soldier brother," she said, "welcome to the
Towers. Why, Johnny, how tall and handsome you are
grown, and so like poor dear George! sit down and tell
me all about yourself, and papa, and dear Maude&mdash;and
look, Johnny, at baby; I am so glad he was a boy,&mdash;how
Wentworth did rejoice; and my little Edie, isn't
she a darling? Come, love, and kiss your uncle."</p>

<p>The little girl toddled up, and with her outspread arms,
saluted him&mdash;his was that open face children like.</p>

<p>The beautiful Countess, whom time had moulded into
a more lovely being still, gazed with a mother's pride on
her fine children, and a sister's joy on her youthful
brother. Certainly if there was a happy mind on the
face of the earth it was hers then&mdash;happy in her husband,
who loved her with the most faithful adoration, happy
in her children, pledges of that holy tie; happy in her
brother&mdash;her family; and happiest of all in herself&mdash;her
own virtues; a mind in unity with God and her fellow-creatures;
a heart full of charity; a love faithful and
true; one in which her husband's heart could safely
trust, above even the breath of suspicion, as the poet
beautifully says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And on that cheek, and o'er that brow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So soft, so calm, so eloquent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smiles that win, the tints that glow;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But tell of days in goodness spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mind at peace with all below,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A heart whose love is innocent!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such was Ellen; and if she looked with pride and joy
on her brother, who was growing all she could wish, it is
not too much to say, he gazed on her with a feeling bordering
almost on adoration. She seemed a being almost
too good for earth, and exciting worship as her adequate
homage! So far his most sanguine hopes were realised,&mdash;at
least he had a fond sister there, and he had also the
Earl, whom alone he had often seen, and who was the
most delighted at his conduct. Still, there was one
he had not seen, and it was long ere he summoned resolution
to ask even his sister after Lady Florence.</p>

<p>"Oh, Florence is out riding with Wentworth. If I had
not had baby to take care of I should have gone too, and
you would have had a cold welcome, Johnny! How glad
I am I was at home!"</p>

<p>After speaking on many other things, at last the door
opened, and a face too dearly remembered appeared;&mdash;Lady
Florence was eighteen,&mdash;still in her teens,&mdash;that
delightful affix to the numbers that afterwards move less
musically! Her face seemed exactly the same,&mdash;as did
her figure, shown off to perfection by her riding habit,
save that the girlish expression was softened into the
more sober air of riper, though still youthful years, and
the light form more rounded, and developed into the contour
of woman's figure. She wore a black velvet hat
with a white feather coquettishly displayed, and in one
of her little hands, covered with white gauntlets, she
balanced a riding-whip, whilst the other held up her
train. John was partly hidden by the white muslin curtains,
and the young lady did not observe him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ellen,&mdash;you in yet? I thought you would have
been out this fine day!" and she was on the point of
shutting the door, when the Countess said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Florence, love! where are your eyes? Do you
not see my brother John, who is just arrived?"</p>

<p>A faint blush for a moment crimsoned her face; then,
apologizing for her mistake, she walked gracefully forward,
while young Ravensworth leapt up and hurried to
meet her.</p>

<p>"So you have arrived, Mr. Ravensworth;&mdash;I am glad
to renew our old acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Not more than I am, Lady Florence. Why you are
not altered the least; I should have known no difference!"</p>

<p>"You flatter me," answered the lady, giving her hand;
"but I must say, I doubt if I should have known <i>you</i>
again. Why, dear me, Ellen, when last I saw him he
was not so tall as I am, and now he is a head over me!
I must now look up to you, Mr. Ravensworth,&mdash;you are
grown out of my recollection almost!"</p>

<p>"I trust not out of your remembrance, Lady Florence?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not out of yours, if I am to judge by your
shakes of hand. You forget you are now so strong;&mdash;you
nearly wrung my poor hand off! Excuse me now;
I must go and change my habit,&mdash;<i>Addio!</i>"</p>

<p>The light-hearted girl then sailed away, leaving her
admirer in half-hopefulness, half-fearfulness, and scarce
knowing what to think.</p>

<p>The Earl's reception was as warm as he had anticipated;
and he then left in order to dress for dinner.
Several guests besides himself were numbered at the
table, and, of course, Lady Florence fell to the care of a
young peer, and not to him; she sat a few paces from
him on the same side,&mdash;just too far for him to address,
and not too far for him to listen to. Her partner seemed
to pay the most assiduous attentions, which were certainly,
as far as he could judge, far from unacceptable, and he was
not altogether sorry when the ladies left. When they
rejoined them in the drawing-room, he was quite monopolized
by his sister, whilst Lady Florence was disengaged;
and when, at last, he got free, the same young
man walked up to her, just before him, and kept up incessant
flirtation. During the whole evening he but once
addressed her, and only received a laughing repartee.
Time wore on; Lady Florence was one of the earliest to
retire, and by-and-by the visitors departed, and he too
went to his room anything but pleased:&mdash;it seemed
quite certain she had forgotten him. Next morning, at
breakfast, he sat next her, and she seemed so like herself
again his spirits quite rose; but during the rest of
the day she hardly noticed him; and again he sought
his couch thoroughly discontented. During the days he
was of course carried off to the field by the Earl, who
was a keen sportsman; and as a large shooting party
gradually gathered at the Towers, his chances for a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
with Lady Florence grew more and more hopeless.
He saw her the star of every drawing-room; she
danced and laughed with him, and quite won him,&mdash;often
thrice in an evening; and then he saw her treating
some one else exactly the same; and at length came to
the conclusion that she was a heartless flirt! The days
hurried by, and soon he would have to say adieu! and
sail for India. He tried to reason with himself, how he
could be so foolish as to think the reigning belle of
town and country, and daughter of an Earl, could deign
to look on him, save as on any other young man. But
love will not listen to reason,&mdash;and he loved! Yet he
soon came to the sad conclusion, he would have to leave
without even speaking to her on the subject; he would
soon hear of her alliance with some noble family, and
then he would throw his life away in the first brush with
the enemy! All his high hopes of coming home a conquering
hero, and receiving as his guerdon the hand of
the lady of his choice seemed to "moulder cold and low!"
When she saw his death, she would perhaps say, "Poor
fellow!&mdash;he is gone at last!"&mdash;this all from one who had
said she would be his wife:&mdash;oh, the thought was maddening!
Those were her girlish vows,&mdash;unstable as the
name traced on the sands,&mdash;so her vows were washed
away by the stream of years! Oh, woman, thy faith is
written on sand!</p>

<p>The most provoking part was, she would often walk
with him, ride with him, sit with him alone; she would
listen to all his nonsense, and flirt in her turn; and after
these interviews he used to return vexed with himself for
frittering precious time in folly, and vexed with her for
returning it too well.</p>

<p>In this way three weeks passed away. During the next
few days he fancied he saw a change in Florence: she
was less frivolous,&mdash;she seemed more quiet; and he
could not but connect it in his own mind with his
approaching departure, and said to himself, "She has a
heart, after all!" Three days only of his tether remained,
when, one afternoon, he found himself walking with
Florence alone in the shrubberies; he nerved himself up,
and determined he would speak his whole mind, and
began by asking her "if she remembered what she had
told him two years ago?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Ravensworth, if I remembered all the
foolish things I said, I should have enough to do."</p>

<p>"Then, Lady Florence, those days are gone. I would
I were Johnny Ravensworth again,&mdash;could you be the
same you were then to me."</p>

<p>"I scarcely understand you. I have always been
amused at your pleasantries; I have always liked your
company,&mdash;but you did not, I hope, imagine more."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lady Florence, do not say so! Have you, indeed,
forgotten all you once said,&mdash;how often you promised
and vowed affection to me?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Ravensworth, I was then a girl, and you were
then my playmate. There was no harm, then, in our
being so much together, or in all the foolish things we
said to each other. We are now nearly grown up; and
I hope your good taste will allow, we could not go on as
we did then,&mdash;why, the world would never let us hear
the end of it."</p>

<p>"Would God, Lady Florence, I was the same heedless
boy again! Oh! to grow beyond our childish loves is
surely the bitterest part of life! To be brief,&mdash;you love
me no more?"</p>

<p>"I am grieved to hurt your feelings, Mr. Ravensworth,&mdash;I
really never dreamed of this! You are a
friend,&mdash;a near and dear friend,&mdash;and shall ever remain
so."</p>

<p>"Then, all my hopes sink,&mdash;all my fondest hopes are
crushed! Oh! why did you draw me on only to crush me?
Why did you lead me,&mdash;why did you encourage me,&mdash;only
to blight my best affections? It cannot be you have
ceased to regard me! Oh, Lady Florence,&mdash;dear Lady
Florence, have pity on me!"</p>

<p>"I shall ever regard you as I have done, and still do,
Mr. Ravensworth; no one could feel more sorry than I
do. If I have awakened hopes I never dreamed of raising,
it will read me a lesson to be more careful in future.
I sincerely regret I cannot reciprocate your feelings;&mdash;may
you meet some one who can, and who will make
you happier than Florence de Vere!"</p>

<p>The young girl broke away without listening for a
reply, and hurried to her room. When she was alone
she threw herself on her bed and burst into tears, exclaiming,
"God forgive me!&mdash;how could I tell him such
a falsehood? I do,&mdash;I do love him! What made me
so foolish, so mad, as to refuse him?"</p>

<p>At dinner they met. You could hardly tell anything
was wrong, to listen to those two, speaking so merrily;
but, could you have read their hearts,&mdash;what a tale of
wretchedness was there! Young Ravensworth felt
utterly cast down at heart: he had heard from the lips
he best loved to hear the words that spoke his doom!
He had proved her he thought faithful, false! His trust
in womankind was gone; but he felt he must veil his
feelings. "I will show her," thought he, "I can laugh,
and sing, and, with false smiles on my face, throw a
light on sorrow's dark tide. I will not let the cold world
know my misery; but, after once finding the fickleness
of the sex, I will not try it again."</p>

<p>Alas! Ravensworth did not know how often a proud
beautiful girl rejects the love she would accept from a
vanity man knows not&mdash;the vanity and pleasure of playing
with hearts! Lady Florence felt grieved that she
should have dallied with deep feelings, all for the silly
pleasure of seeing her powers; but she felt faith in those
powers, and thought her smiles would tempt the moth,
even after singeing its wings, once more to woo the
flame. Alas! Lady Florence knew not there are hearts
which, once refused, are too haughty to ask again. Time
was short&mdash;two days only&mdash;and early on the morning
of the third John Ravensworth must start. Florence,
by all means in her power, strove to rekindle the
flame her refusal seemed to have quenched. Young
Ravensworth was partly surprised, partly angered at
this, to his idea, heartless trifling. A word would have
set all right; had he asked again she would have become
his betrothed, but he asked not. Had she only
whispered, "I do love you," he would again have asked&mdash;she
spoke not. And thus whilst she fancied he was
too proud to ask, and resolved to lower that pride by
appearing everything he wished, all to make him ask
once more, he fancied it was cruelty in her appearing so
affectionate, all to induce him to ask again, that she
might once more have the pleasure of refusing, and he
resolved he would not give her the chance. Thus a
mutual feeling of restraint prevented each of them
from saying the word or making the concession on which
their future joy or sorrow depended! Time, which
stays his course not for mortal man, wore on; the day&mdash;the
last day&mdash;hurried by! The excitement of packing,
preparing, and looking at the beautiful presents showered
on him from all sides, partly distracted Ravensworth
from gnawing care; yet through all he felt that sinking,
aching void within which only one could fill. He had
no present from her he valued most, not even a flower!
and a flower from her were worth the wealth of Golconda
from others. The evening&mdash;though he wooed its
stay as if it were his last below&mdash;passed away with the
rapidity happy hours do pass. He sat by her&mdash;talked
to her; she played and sang to him, and he was at once
happy and wretched. One song&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>the latest production of Lord Byron's muse then
set to music, she sang with such pathos the tear
sprang to his eyes. But afterwards she laughed, and
his spirits sank again as she bade him good evening
and good bye.</p>

<p>"Good bye; I shall not see you again, Mr. Ravensworth;
you will be gone early, I suppose. When we
meet again you will be a captain perhaps. I hope you
will have a nice voyage. Good bye, I sha'n't forget
you."</p>

<p>Poor Ravensworth could only press her hand as she
was leaving the room, and offer a little packet, probably
containing a costly keepsake, but Lady Florence fathomed
his meaning, and said, "Thank you, but I could
not accept it, it would not be right; I shall require no
souvenir to cause you to be remembered! but if you
want one, there is a flower for you." As she spoke she
took a sprig of blue forget-me-not from the wreath that
bound her hair, and playfully gave it. She then hurried
away with a light step, but a heavy heart. Young
Ravensworth stood mute, with the rejected gift in one
hand and the flower in the other, gazing abstractedly
on his retreating vision of beauty. He thought he heard
her sigh. He then slowly retraced his steps, bade farewell
to the Countess, and retired to his own room, heavy
and discontented. He could not sleep, so fevered grew
his head, and thinking the cool night air might do him
good, he left the castle, crossed the span-bridge, and
sought the Holly Walk. The night was extremely beautiful,
the moon walking on high in brightness, the air
warm and perfumed as it swept o'er the flower-gardens,
and gently whirled the sere leaves from the beech-trees
behind the hedge.</p>

<p>What a different scene had been enacted there a few
years ago! Awful as it was, to him it was brighter
than now, and as he marked the leaves fall, silently but
surely, before the touch of the waning year, so, he
thought, fall my hopes one by one, till old age will
leave me without a leaf to bless the bare branches. He
sat down on a bench, and there taking the little rejected
packet, he broke the seal, tore to fragments a few lines
of poetry he had written and wrapped the little brooch
in, and scattered the fragments amongst the dried holly-leaves
at the root of the hedge. We are, however, able
to state they ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is false! she is no pole-star, and my nonsense isn't
worth burning," exclaimed the unhappy lover. "And
thou, poor rejected souvenir, no eye shall ever see thee!"
dropping it on the ground, he stamped the brooch into
the greensward in his fury. He looked up,&mdash;you could
scarce have told that pale livid face to be the same
bright visage that smiled as he received his medal. He
arose and retraced his footsteps towards the Towers.
Once or twice he fancied he heard a rustle among the
branches at the back of the hedge; as he neared the
end of the walk the sound rose so distinctly on his ear
it made him start. He was brave as a lion, but not
untinctured with the superstition of the North. The
idea at once struck him it was the spirit of Musgrave
haunting the walk where he had been murdered. An
involuntary thrill ran through him; he stood as if rooted
to the ground, and he felt his hair somewhat bristle on
his head. Had it been twenty robbers he had not known
a particle of dread, but anything supernatural was
horrid! It was some moments ere he found his voice,
and he was almost ashamed of himself to hear how it
quavered as he asked, "Who goes there?" No answer
came; the rustling came nearer, and through the
branches he saw a dim white figure approaching. His
heart sank within him, and in a voice tremulous and
hollow he asked, "In God's name who are you? avaunt!
away! by all that is sacred go!" The cold drops stood
on his brow like icicles, and his whole frame shook.</p>

<p>"Hist, speak low&mdash;follow me," replied a female voice,
and at the same moment the form broke through the
bushes. For an instant he thought it was Lady Florence,
but no, she was an inch taller at least, and it was
not the light beautifully-moulded figure of the lady of
his love. "Are you ill? are you glamoured, that you
will nae speak nor move? You look dumbfoundered as
if a ghaist had speered on you. Quick, follow me, Mr.
John."</p>

<p>"By heaven! I did think it was a ghost! What, in
the name of God, brings you here in such a place, at
such an hour? By my troth I did think it was Sir
Richard's spirit."</p>

<p>"Whisht, for the love of God dinna speak sae.
Dinna ye ken the place is no canny? Follow me. But
you are a brave sodger."</p>

<p>Young Ravensworth felt his blood kindle, and felt
angry at his folly in imagining she was a ghost, and
eager to disabuse her of the idea, said, "No, Jenny,
speak here&mdash;it is all trash&mdash;what is it?"</p>

<p>"Na, na, not here. Either come, or I maun tell her
ye willna come ava."</p>

<p>"Her, who is her? I will come."</p>

<p>And he hastened to follow Jeanie Forbes, who, when
the rest of the family had left, was promoted to the rank
of lady's-maid to Lady Florence, as a reward for her
uniform kindness to the Countess in her imprisonment.
Following his guide, he entered the castle by a back-door,
and ascended the back-stairs till he reached the door of
Lady Florence's room. "Tap thrice," said his guide,
and disappeared in the darkness. For a minute he stood
irresolute whether he should tap or not. Love overcame
pride, and he gently struck the door thrice. A light
step crossed the room, the door was opened, and he stood
face to face with his lady love.</p>

<p>"Come in; tread lightly," said the lady. "Oh! I
am doing very wrong, Mr. Ravensworth! but I could
not let you leave this without seeing you once more.
It is very wrong&mdash;it may be, unmaidenly&mdash;I cannot
help it! Sit down&mdash;there," pointing to a sofa.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what he did, he sank down on the
sofa as he was bid.</p>

<p>Lady Florence still kept standing.</p>

<p>"Why have you brought me here, Lady Florence?
For heaven's sake relieve me of my doubts!"</p>

<p>The lady stood speechless.</p>

<p>It was a fine picture: the despairing look of the
lover, with his eyes cast on the ground, as if unable to
lift them to the idol of his affections; the half earthly,
half heavenly look of the lady, as if dying to breathe
a word and kept back by an irresistible chain.
She was still, of course, dressed as he had last seen her,
save that her hair was let down, and in long tresses
almost swept the ground as she bent forward, and with
eyes swelling with tears, and hands clasped together,
exclaimed, "Johnny, I <i>do</i> love you!"</p>

<p>As though he heard not, or understood not, he was
silent as death for some seconds, and contending passions
strove for mastery in his bosom. The pride, that would
rather suffer than bend, fought against the love that
would rather die than cause its object to suffer. For a
few dread moments they fiercely contended, and, alas
for love! pride vanquished, and he replied, "Lady
Florence, you have trifled once with my tenderest feelings;
you shall not again. Once refused, I am too
proud to implore again the love denied me. Would we
had not met! My peace is gone,&mdash;perhaps yours also."</p>

<p>"Hear me, Johnny&mdash;hear me! I repent,&mdash;I bitterly
repent of my folly. Why this false pride? Your peace,
you say, is gone. I can give it back. My peace is
gone. You can give it me again. Let me not ask in
vain!"</p>

<p>"Alas! it is too late now, Florence!" said her lover,
relenting. "I had my resignation penned when I asked
you. I had given up all my dreams of glory for you! I
have sent the letter stating I am ready for service. At
the least, it will be years ere we meet again; but if my
Florence will be true, she need not fear my infidelity."</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed the unhappy young lady, "I
am punished indeed! But, oh, Johnny! it is not too
late! it is not! Wentworth has such interest; he will
get your discharge. You can sell your commission. What
is glory? An empty dream! The mere bray of the
trumpet! Oh! stay, stay with your Florence&mdash;your
beloved, loving Florence! Do not leave me!" and the
young girl threw her arms round him, as if she would
not let him go.</p>

<p>He felt the embarrassment of his situation; he felt
a softness stealing over his soul, he felt his decision
all melting away; he saw how much she was devoted
to him. He then thought of martial glory; high fame;
and his honour; his duty; and then again of love and
home delights! Half he was inclined to throw over all,
and spend his life in inglorious indolence,&mdash;in retired,
blissful, domestic happiness! but again feelings the
young soldier only knows&mdash;the sound of the trumpet,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"whose breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May lead to death,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But never to retreating,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>spoke in his ear, and again love failed, and glory won
the battle.</p>

<p>"Nay, my gentle Florence, not even love must bring
dishonour. I have pledged myself a soldier of the
King. I am no more my own. My fellow-soldiers are
bleeding, and suffering hunger, vigil, heat, marching;
and shall I in indulgent ease stay at home in beauty's
arms? No; had it been earlier, before that letter
went, it might have been. But regrets are vain.
It is too late now! Honour, and glory, and duty
before even love! But weep not, my own darling,
I will soon come home crowned with laurels; and you
shall welcome me home! And the thought of the girl
I left behind me will steel my sword, nerve my soul;
and in battle I will think both of you and my country,
and fight for each more valiantly! And, should I fall,
I will die happy, knowing that Florence will weep over
her soldier lover!"</p>

<p>"No! no! you shall not, must not go! I should
never see you again! They would kill you! If you
must go, let me go with you. I will share your tent
and your danger, and bind your wounds, and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The rest was lost in sobs.</p>

<p>The lover disengaged himself tenderly from the weeping
girl's arms, and again and again kissing her velvet
brow, bidding her farewell, and lingering, and again
kissing her, at last left her, with, "God bless you, my
own darling! Adieu! adieu! I shall not see you
again; let this be our parting. Your tears might shake
my purpose; and even Florence would not wish that."</p>

<p>He then sought his own room, first asking Jeanie
Forbes, who watched outside, to wait a few minutes
whilst he penned a note. He sat down and hurriedly
wrote the verses we have already made our readers
acquainted with, from his memory, and, folding them
up, sent them to Lady Florence by Jeanie, to whom he
gave a valuable ring, as a memento.</p>

<p>Early next morning our hero arose, and, unable to eat
more than an apology of a breakfast with Lord Wentworth,
who alone was up, prepared to leave for ever.
He never came back.</p>

<p>"Give my love to Ellen, and to your sister," he said,
as he got into the post-chaise, which was to tear him
from all he prized. He felt a choking sensation from
grief as he said the words.</p>

<p>"I will. God bless you, my boy! win laurels and
then lady-love!" said the Earl, shaking hands.</p>

<p>Just as the carriage was starting Jeanie Forbes
hurried up and pressed a note into his hand. He
could hardly read it, so dizzy grew his brain. On the
outside were the words "Look to my window."</p>

<p>The carriage started. As it crossed the bridge he
looked towards the window of the room in which all that
was dear then was. He saw a white figure, and a
whiter arm that waved a kerchief. He kissed his hand;
and then an envious corner of the castle hid all from his
view. Again the window re-appeared as he drove
smartly down the park road. He looked back, his eye
fixed on that lattice, and the white kerchief and the
arm that waved it! But the horses cruelly trotted on;
it grew fainter and further&mdash;further and fainter&mdash;dimmer
still&mdash;until not even an eye of fondest hero could
detect it any more.</p>

<p>He sank back with a feeling of utter heartbroken
and sickening grief&mdash;as if deserted by all he loved.
Had she asked him then, he had thrown honour, glory,
duty to the winds!</p>

<p>As he drove on, the first poignancy passed away, and he
began to break the seal of the note he had not yet read.
As he opened it a long tress of her golden hair fell out
at his feet. He picked it up and pressed it to his lips.
The letter ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Johnny</span>,</p>

<p>"I am punished for my vanity; but let it pass.
It is vain to lament what is done. You did right.
Had you stayed I would not have loved you half as
much as I now do, though it would have gratified my
wishes. Johnny, I shall ever think of you in my
prayers&mdash;when tossed on the restless billow&mdash;when on the
battle-field&mdash;when on the sultry march. When at even
you see the star we have gazed on so oft, you will think
it is the morning star of my hopes! Farewell, Johnny!
And whether we meet again or not, our vows shall never
be broken. Farewell! If you come back you will find
Florence faithful. Nothing but death shall then part
us. And, if you die a soldier's death, you shall have
it watered with Florence's tears.</p></div>

<p>We shall no longer spin out this already long chapter,
but merely add, the vessel that bore John Ravensworth,

India, but</p>

was long unknown.</p>

<p>John Ravensworth was an expert swimmer, and we

sank with her name on his lips to whom it belonged!</p>

<p>Lady Florence was, as may be easily imagined, totally
unable to appear on the morning of Ravensworth's departure.
She had watched him, as we know, from her windows,
waved her parting sign, and if her young adorer's
eyes had been strained to catch the last glimpse of her
kerchief, not the less had hers been to see the last
vestige of his carriage. In this she had the advantage,
as her eye could trace it receding long after he
had lost her signal. She watched it till it grew a
mere speck on the white road, and at last disappeared
altogether. When all was gone the hapless girl gave
way to her grief, and mourned her folly in a paroxysm of
weeping. Oh! if she could recall that hated day! she
had done all, she had banished him, her vanity had its
due reward. The absence of Lady Florence was a
matter of no comment; she often took her breakfast in
her room, and neither the Earl nor Countess dreamed
the truth. The latter was unusually dispirited by the
departure of her brother, and altogether it was but a
sombre house. After breakfast the Earl took his gun,
and strolled out after some partridges.</p>

<p>"We miss Mr. John, my Lord," said the keeper, "he
was ay first and foremost wi' his gun; he's a braw young
man, and a pity it is he should gae to throw awa his
life in the Indies, folk are sure best at hame!"</p>

<p>"You forget, Halket, he likes it. Do you think every
young man likes to stay at home like yourself? I am
sure if I were unmarried I would have been off with
Ravensworth too. What think you of shooting tigers and
elephants? better than this," said the Earl bringing down
a brace of partridges right and left.</p>

<p>"Na, na, my Lord, scarce better,&mdash;besides the het sun;
I have cause to know about it, having lost two sons in
the Indies of Yellow Jack, as they call the fever; fine
lads they were, and most like Mr. John that's gone."</p>

<p>"Tuts, that was in the West Indies, not where Mr.
Ravensworth is gone; it's a fine climate, perhaps a little
hot, but to a steady young fellow like him there is no fear."</p>

<p>"West or East Indies, it's all one; I say to the devil
with foreign lands, begging your Lordship's pardon for
the word, and hoora for auld Scotland, na place like
hame."</p>

<p>"You had better mind your business, and let Mr.
Ravensworth mind his own, and talk less&mdash;see, your
chattering has put up a whole covey out of shot! do
hold your tongue."</p>

<p>Halket saw he had better be still, and sought to remedy
his error by more sportsmanlike behaviour, whistled the
dogs nearer in, and tried a turnip field where he had
marked the birds to.</p>

<p>Meantime the Countess getting uneasy at the continued
absence of Lady Florence, went up to her room
and, after knocking twice without gaining any reply,
opened the door, and was much surprised to find her
sister lying dressed on the sofa, crying like a child.</p>

<p>"My darling, what is wrong? why did you not tell me
you were unwell? what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all my doing! poor Johnny, poor Johnny!
I shall never see him again. Oh, that I was dead!"
cried the poor girl, scarcely knowing what she was
saying.</p>

<p>"Hush, dear, do not say so! why, Florence, I never
dreamed you loved him&mdash;I am sure you let none of us
guess it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it! it was my cruel, wicked heart.&mdash;I did
love him, and I told him falsehood, and then it was too
late. Oh, I shall never see him again!"</p>

<p>"Gently, love, I hardly understand you; tell me all,
hide nothing. You need not fear me, I will not betray
my trust."</p>

<p>In broken sentences, Lady Florence then told the whole
to the Countess, and when she had finished broke into
a fresh flood of tears.</p>

<p>"I am glad, love, you told me all, and while it was
foolish at the first to trifle with such fragile things as
hearts, it is all for the best. I am glad Johnny showed
himself such a true man as he did; I could hardly have
thought such a young creature could have decided so
properly. And you, darling, did right too not to press
him against his conscience. Never mind, it is these
partings that make such pleasant meetings! he will
come back again, and you shall prove how faithful you
are. Come, Florence, cheer up, and you shall find I will
not let you forget Johnny. I am sure you are both worthy
of each other, you both did right."</p>

<p>With these and many other kind words the Countess
cheered her young friend; and, as she had known herself
what the pangs of love were, she could the better
sympathize as only those who have felt like feelings
<i>can</i> do.</p>

<p>"You are better than I was, Floss, for I thought my
lover was untrue, and you know yours is faithful! come
we must see you smile, you wouldn't like Johnny to
come back and find all your roses gone."</p>

<p>Lady Florence was a sensible girl, and convinced that
the Countess was right strove to bear up against her
feelings. By-and-by she was well enough to come down
and go on as usual. She took a walk with Ellen in the
afternoon, selecting the Holly Walk, as she knew that was
the place where he had last walked. She and the
Countess by chance sat down on the very seat where
fifteen hours ago he had sat in so dejected a frame of
mind. As they were talking, and of course speaking
only of the absent one, Florence's quick eye detected
the place where the little gift she had rejected was
crushed into the velvet soil.</p>

<p>"Why, Ellen, what is this shining so bright?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I can't think; this is where Jeanie saw
him sitting so long; you know she said he stamped
something into the ground, and tore a letter to pieces&mdash;look
Florence, love, there are some of the pieces blowing
about."</p>

<p>"I wonder, oh, I wonder if it is the little packet I
refused last night! yes, Ellen, it must be; see, here is the
paper it was wrapt in, with his seal on the wax, the lion
rampant, and eastern crown!&mdash;quite prophetic&mdash;and
your motto, '<i>Unus et idem</i>,' what does that mean, Ellen?
we will ask Wentworth."</p>

<p>The little brooch was soon rescued from its prison, and
though somewhat the worse for its rough usage, Florence
determined to have it put right again; which was
done, and she ever afterwards wore it.</p>

<p>"Wentworth, what does '<i>unus et idem</i>' mean?"</p>

<p>"<i>Unus et idem</i>, what put that into your head,
Floss?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, and don't give Scotch answers. I asked
you what it meant, and you, by way of answer, ask me
what put it into my head? I believe you have forgotten
your Latin."</p>

<p>"No, no, not yet; it means 'one and the same,' Floss;
and now give me a direct answer, and tell me why you
want the motto of the Ravensworths translated&mdash;ah,
your blush tells the tale! never mind, Floss, I couldn't
wish you a better lover."</p>

<p>Days passed away&mdash;slowly at first, then more rapidly&mdash;and
in a week or ten days the Countess received a long
letter from Johnny just before his embarkation; enclosed
was a note to Florence, in which he again declared his
undying love, and faith; it was written in high spirits,
and more than anything tended to raise those of Florence;
after all it was but a year or two, and then they would
meet again. She began to look and feel bright once
more; yet all her flippancy and flirtation were for
ever gone, as the young peer John Ravensworth had
been so jealous of found to his cost when he next met
her. The day after the arrival of the letter, the newspapers
announced that H. M. S. "Recluse" had sailed
from Southampton for Calcutta, with a company of
soldiers and several young officers. As all regrets were
vain now, Lady Florence ceased to grieve over the unhappy
circumstance that had driven them apart for so
long, and amused herself by following in her mind the
voyage of the gallant ship that bore him she loved so far
away. She knew too he was thinking of her, and when
at evening she watched the western star she often fancied
how he was perhaps gazing on the selfsame planet,
and it seemed as if an electric chain bound them together
whilst severed so far. Often when at night the
wind whistled shrill through the lofty towers,&mdash;when, too,
the equinoctial gales roared amid the surrounding woods,
strewing the ground with summer's leafy honours, or
whirling the broken boughs across the park,&mdash;she would
quail in heart, as she thought how one she loved was tost
on the angry billow, whilst the fine vessel was like a
cockleshell on the hissing surge, then she would lift her
heartfelt prayer, as she lay on her wakeful couch&mdash;to
Him in whose hand is the broad ocean, who in the
wildest turmoil can say, Peace, be still! and commend
her lover to his sleepless care. The Countess was agreeably
surprised to see how well her friend kept her
plighted faith, and she had no reason to fan the flame,
which seemed to grow brighter and brighter every moment.
She often used to walk with her, and lead her
mind gently and unostensibly to better things than the
light, and, if harmless, certainly useless frivolities in
which she had so long shone the admired of all; indeed
her own inclinations were little bent towards such amusements
now. Before her parting with John she had
been like a child, happy in some fair garden, chasing the
butterfly from flower to flower, careless of all save the
present moment, forgetful of the past, heedless of the
future, without aim or object save pleasure. Now it was
as if some one had pointed out the shining light, as did
Evangelist to the Pilgrim&mdash;now she cared not how soon
she left idle follies; she had something to live for, something
to aim at, something to think on as a spur to future
progress. The past was as a reminder a noble prize was
in view, and she pressed forward to obtain it. The change
of mind produced a corresponding change even in her
appearance. The coquettish smile, the careless toss of
the head, the very walk, were either gone or mellowed
down; without being crushed the exhilarant spirits were
chastened, and no one could have told her to be the
same being she had been only a few weeks ago. It was
all a change for the better; the Earl loved her more as
Il Penseroso, than he did as L'Allegro. The Countess
loved her more, and she won the most favourable opinions
from all her friends and relatives, who saw the
change without being privy to the cause. To use a
hackneyed similitude, she had been like the plant, which
uncrushed is beautiful, yet void of perfume, but which
gives out its most precious odours when bruised and
crushed.</p>

<p>About a month after young Ravensworth had sailed
the papers reported the safe arrival of the vessel off
Funchal in the Madeiras. The ship which had spoken the
"Recluse," also brought home letters,&mdash;a long and affectionate
one to Lady Florence from himself, in which
he gave an interesting account of his voyage, and all the
wonders of the deep he had seen. Several very nice
young fellows were on board, as well as many ladies
going out to their husbands or friends; one exceedingly
pretty, with whom he was a great favourite, he added by
way of raillery, and he was quite afraid she would make
him forget Florence. He said he was drest in sailor's
costume, and helped the tars in their tasks aloft; they
had dancing by moonlight every night&mdash;the air was clear
and delightful, and they were nearing the Trades.
Funchal was a little Paradise on the waters, such flowers
and fruits, he wished he could send some of its wines to
the Marquis. The stars were magnificent, and the
southern constellations daily growing more splendid, and
more brilliant than dwellers in the northern zone could
imagine. He ended by tenderest love to his Florence
and the Countess, and best remembrances to the Earl,
saying he hoped to bring home the sword he had given
him hacked like a saw in many a stiff encounter.
Months passed by, and then a second letter from St.
Helena arrived; so far all had gone well, their sails were
filled with the fresh trade winds again, after three weeks'
becalming in the tropics, under a fierce red sun, vertical,
and casting such rays as melted the very tar on the
ropes, and beneath which the waters seethed like pitch.
They had only anchored off the island, not being allowed
to land owing to its then being the prison of the illustrious
Buonaparte. He spoke with great delight about
the cross of the south, a constellation surpassing all his
powers of description; "and yet," he added, "when on
the line I beheld the great bear's seven stars, magnified
into fearful splendour, as if most glorious ere it left its
old friends, I turned from the flaming southern cross to
those stars sinking beneath the waters, and they alone
were dear! the only, lonely lights that still bound us
together, and I sorrowed when I could see no more the
well-known, cherished cluster that shines on the north,
and <i>my</i> northern star."</p>

<p>This was the last letter Florence ever received from
him; long ere she read its welcome news the hand that
penned it was cold, the heart that dictated it forgotten
to throb far beneath the blue waters, lowly laid among
the coral reefs. The "Recluse" was to touch at the Cape,
but it never cast anchor in sight of Table Mountain. In
vain Florence scanned the papers, in vain she read the
ship news; time passed on, and no letter came. News
arrived that some terrific gales had swept the ocean at
the time the "Recluse" was expected to reach Cape
Town, and it was surmised she had run past, and would
perhaps steer for Madagascar. Two more anxious
months passed away, in which the Earl and family left
the Towers for their town residence&mdash;still no news of
the vessel; by-and-by the Earl himself, who had been
the most sanguine, began to despond, and grow anxious.
The papers were full of the missing vessel, in which some
of the flower of the land had sailed. Lady Florence
grew pale and paler still, as vessel after vessel arrived,
and no news of the missing ship. By this time it ought to
have long since arrived in India, and doubts became
almost certain conjectures that she was lost. Still it
was possible that she might have put in at some out of
the way harbour in a disabled condition, and hope still
lingered in many a mourner's breast. A war ship was
sent out by the Admiralty and scoured the seas in search
of her; every port was called at, but without avail.
After a long age of suspense, and hope deferred which
sickens the heart, the frigate returned without tidings,
and the "Recluse" was struck from the Navy List. Lady
Florence still hoped, so long is it before we bid hope
depart! Ships had been lost ere this for years; he was such
a fine swimmer he might have been picked up by a
vessel, which had sailed to the other end of the world,
or cast on a barren rock, and like Alexander Selkirk
might come back after long years. About a year after
the search a little vessel arrived at Liverpool with news,
the only news ever gained of the "Recluse," and it was
only cruel tidings that rekindles dying expectation to
quench it again. This vessel had seen the "Recluse"
drifting&mdash;a mastless hulk, on its beam ends, in a fearful
hurricane off the Cape, lat. 40&deg; 7', long. 35&deg; 13'; not a
soul was on deck, and she had neither bowsprit nor
rudder. The little vessel herself could render no assistance,
though she scudded under bare poles so near as to
read her name on the stern. Shortly after she heard a
gun of distress, and the last thing she saw was the ill-fated
vessel lying in the trough of a monstrous billow
which she could never surmount. They fancied this sea
had swamped her, as they neither saw nor heard more of
her afterwards. They declared her case was quite hopeless,
and a worse hurricane they had never weathered.</p>

<p>Such was the news which banished the last ray
of hope from every breast;&mdash;no, not from every breast,
one still madly hoped on. But it was a hope that belied
itself, for the despairing Florence showed her belief,
though she owned it not, by wearing the garb of mourning.
It was a hope which killed its victim. As the
power of swimming holds up the shipwrecked mariner
only a little longer on the wide waters, and makes the
pang of sinking at last only more intense, as he strikes
for the light far in front which he knows he has not the
strength to reach, so Florence's only fed her despair.
This despairing, unbelieving grief was like a blight at
the core; the heart's woe slowly, but surely, worked its
desolations on the fair, frail bearer. It was slowly
received, but lasting; as the frost at night imperceptibly,
but surely, freezes the waters that sleep beneath its
chilling breath; or better still, the unseen, unnoticed,
petrifying water hardens, chills, deadens, the living
grass that grows green on its banks&mdash;so with Lady
Florence, the grief at first discredited, then doubted, and
little by little gradually imbibed into her heart, and
believed&mdash;whilst she denied the pang that killed her,
showed its outward ravages on the pale cheek, tinted
with a hectic flush that told its tale, and in the eye unnaturally
bright. Her friends saw the dire premonitions
of her fate, and her brother took the best medical
advice. But the heart's wounds are not to be cured,
and when the seat of life is touched, when the root is
blighted, woe to the branches!</p>

<p>When the doctor saw his patient he pronounced it at
once a lost case; that fast decline no mortal hand could
arrest, its stay could only be gained by an immediate
removal to a warmer climate. Madeira was first chosen,
but as the Villa Reale at Naples had every comfort of an
English house the doctor decided on her departure
thither, stating that every hour spent in this damp,
foggy country was a day lost. The Earl and Countess,
deeply grieved not only at the untimely death of the
young and promising soldier, who had perished,</p>

</div></div>

<p>but also at the near prospect of another loss to add to
their woe, delayed not in obeying their medical adviser,
and at once started for Naples in their yacht, "The Star
of the Sea." The voyage was specially recommended,
so they sailed with the invalid about to end her short
life amid the flowers and myrtle-groves of Ausonia's
sunny clime and favoured shores!</p>

<p>Though we have not mentioned the grief of the Countess
for her only brother's death, owing to the greater
and more distracting woe of Lady Florence's engaging our
attention, it must not be inferred from thence she did not
deeply and long feel her irreparable loss. After her husband
and children, there was no living being who had so
entwined himself round the young mother's heart as her
brother had ever done. She had had, it might be said,
his entire moral education in her training from a child;
he had grown a credit to his mistress, besides combining
all, in his appearance and manners, that most captivates
woman's heart. She was at once proud and delighted
with her pupil:&mdash;proud to see her careful and painstaking
bringing up had been so well developed, and exceeded
her highest expectations; delighted to see how he reflected
credit on her family; and, most of all, found an
anxious well-wisher in her husband. But alas for early
promise! alas for youthful hopes! The pride of her
eyes, the idol of her heart, had been rudely snatched
away. All her long watching,&mdash;just when the plant was
beginning to reflect glory on its trainer,&mdash;had proved in
vain. The child of so many prayers had early been called
hence; his sun had gone down whilst it was yet day;
in the very spring of its sunshine, at the very hour when
his rays were most cherished, the eclipse had come on
and the Countess felt a double pang in thus losing not
only her brother, but as it were her son,&mdash;for so she
almost regarded him. Her father, too, was an object of
solicitude; he had lost the prop of his old age, his only
surviving son; and so heavily had the loss fallen on him,
it seemed as if he too would soon follow the light of his
eyes to the tomb.</p>

<p>The race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong; and Ellen was now learning, by sad experience,
that to be great is not to be happy,&mdash;to be rich is not
to be free from care. The Weird was fast fulfilling; one
by one, in the bloom of their age, the flowers of the
family were falling off. Lady Arranmore was gone; now
Lady Florence was going;&mdash;who would be the next to
follow? These were sad thoughts, which often cast a
shadow on Ellen's fair face. She was still so young, but
seemed as if she was to be stricken again and again, and
when she looked on her lord, her children, and all over
whom the Weird had its fatal power, she trembled! Her
own sorrows were partly lessened by the task of comforting
and sympathising with the griefs of others. She had
her father in his sonless woe, and Florence in her declining
health; and, like all tender minds, she forgot her
own in alleviating another's misery. She had also her
children to think of, and almost seemed unable to grasp
all her duties, and do all that was required. Had she
not had a higher Comforter, she could never have borne
up against such a complication of disasters; but she had
learned that lesson which is the last a Christian is perfected
in,&mdash;to cast all her care on a greater than any
earthly friend, and to feel sure all was for the best,&mdash;good
would spring from evil;&mdash;yes, often the shadow
goes before the blessing, the cloud before the refreshing
shower, and the shower before the rainbow! The darkest
hour is the hour before dawn; and faith must not tremble
at the dimness of darkness, but look forward to the bright
sun that follows.</p>

<p>The Earl had determined to ask his bereaved father-in-law,
as well as Maude, to pass the winter with them at
Naples; and early in October the whole party started on
their travels, proceeding first to Southampton, and
thence, by the Earl's schooner yacht, to Naples. This
little vessel was commanded by Captain Wilson, who had
retired on half-pay from an ungrateful service, and was
glad to get such an excellent appointment from his
friend. He was much concerned at the altered looks of
his invalid charge, and took the most fatherly care of
her during the voyage. They had a very pleasant passage
after the Bay of Biscay, which kept up its character,
and gave them a stormy welcome. It was a sorrowful
crew, and very unlike the usual voyages in the "Star of
the Sea." Lady Florence and the Countess used often
to sit on the poop, beneath the white awning, and gaze
with a sad delight on the dark blue billows, as they
boomed and hissed past them, with their feathery foam-crests.
Beneath that blue, lone sea slept the loved of all! it
was on those surges, perhaps, he had striven long and well,
but at last succumbed to his fate! Sometimes the wish
would force itself on the mind of Florence that the same
cruel waves would engulf their frail craft, and she would
rest deep under the changing, surging waves; but Ellen
used to tell her it was wrong,&mdash;to bear was to conquer
her fate; when it was Heaven's will, her bark of life would
reach its haven of rest; and from this she gradually went
on, and spoke so sweetly, so gently, to her young friend,
that, little by little, her mind was weaned away from
selfish sorrow, and she half resolved to live for others,&mdash;not
to give way to unavailing grief.</p>

<p>Nine days after they embarked from England, the
"Star of the Sea" anchored off the Molo Grande. After
some trouble with passports, the party disembarked at
the Porto Grande, from whence they drove to the Villa
Reale, so called from the gardens by which it was surrounded
resembling those bearing the same name at
Naples,&mdash;the great promenade in the evenings. About
half an hour's drive on the Castellamare road brought
them to their destination. The villa stood on the rising
ground, sloping upwards towards Vesuvius, which formed
its background to the right. Behind it vineyards, orange
and lemon groves made the white castellated mansion
stand forth gloriously; and Mr. Ravensworth and Maude,
who had never seen Naples before, thought,&mdash;as every
one thinks,&mdash;nothing could be more beautiful! The
warm air, and mild sea breezes, for a time seemed as if
they would restore the drooping Florence; but as the
winter drew on,&mdash;unfortunately rather colder than usual,&mdash;her
cough grew worse, and every eye saw the swift decline
again hurrying its victim to the grave. Lady
Florence alone thought she would recover; alone she
knew not her danger,&mdash;part of the fatal complaint!
Still, it was rather with grief than otherwise she looked
on her restoration. All that she had lived for had gone;
life had nothing now to make her woo its stay; and
often, almost dejectedly, she would say&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall get well, after all, Ellen; I half wish I may
not; and yet there is a lingering love of life, though its
bloom is all gone."</p>

<p>"I hope, my darling, you may."</p>

<p>But Ellen knew her hopes were vain; yet she did not
tell her fears to the invalid.</p>

<p>As the spring came on Florence grew worse. At first
she made long excursions by sea and land,&mdash;to Ischia,
Sorrento, Vesuvius, and many other places; or took long
drives into the interior. Soon she grew unable to bear
these fatigues, and used to drive along the shore, or walk
to the volcano's side only. As she grew weaker, and her
cough became more and more troublesome, and wearing
on the system, even these short excursions were given
up, and the invalid during sunny days used to be
wheeled on a sofa to the balcony, where she used to
gaze listlessly on the blue Mediterranean, or converse
with her friend the Countess, who scarcely ever left her
side. The most skilful medical care now availed nothing,&mdash;slowly,
but surely, the victim sank! the hectic flush
grew brighter, the eye more unearthly clear, the form
more emaciated,&mdash;and then the patient was unable to
leave her dying bed.</p>

<p>Naples is now considered a climate thoroughly unfit
for consumptive patients; but in those days climatology
was not so well understood as now; and the Doctor
balancing the comforts of the Villa Reale with the
miseries of hotels overlooked some more important
items.</p>

<p>Lord Wentworth, when he saw his sister failing so
fast, as a last resource communicated with the then
celebrated Abernethy, who, on hearing the case, ordered
her immediate removal to Rome, or else inland as far
as she could bear the journey. Accordingly a carriage
was fitted up as a couch, and the lady removed from the
Villa Reale, travelling by easy stages to the ancient mistress
of the world. The journey again seemed to feed
the dying flame of life, and the Earl with joy beheld his
sister able to be wheeled once more to the balcony of the
palace which he rented. It was but once she was permitted
to do this: never more did she quit her couch.
The fatal sirocco blew for three days, and this seemed
to dry up the last hope. On the evening of the last day
she called her friends to her bedside, and told them she
was dying. The scene was peculiarly sad. From their windows
they saw the Capitol with its ruined towers in the
last light of day,&mdash;and her sun was sinking too! The
Earl sat with downcast looks near the foot of the dying
girl's bed; Mr. Ravensworth and Maude sat on one side,
and on the other knelt the Countess whispering words of
comfort in her friend's ear. The expiring beauty sat up
in her bed, and, pointing to the reflected beams on the
ruins, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My sun is, too, setting, Ellen; if there is one grief in
parting, it is leaving you."</p>

<p>"You will rise again, as will that orb, brighter, and in
a better land, Florence love! But, oh! it is hard to
lose you, though we should not grudge the change from
weeping into glory, and life into eternity. Are you
happy, dear?"</p>

<p>"I never was happier; could all my life be promised
over again, I would not wish to live! to die is far better.
I do but go before, Ellen, and I shall see him!"</p>

<p>She then lay down again as if exhausted; her
breathing became quicker, as though she almost panted
for breath; a light of glory seemed to shine on her face,
and her eye looked brighter still; her lips moved as
though she were speaking, but no words were whispered.</p>

<p>"Did you speak, love?" asked the Countess.</p>

<p>"I am dying now,&mdash;I feel the chain that still holds
me here slackening fast. Ellen, love, farewell!&mdash;Wentworth,&mdash;dear
Maude, and&mdash;Mr. Ra&mdash;vensworth&mdash;adieu!
adieu!"</p>

<p>The last few words were rather guessed than heard.
The Earl rose and hastened to his wife's side; kneeling
down, he took his sister's hand, which he pressed to his
lips,&mdash;it was growing cold. Just then the Doctor entered.
He did not speak, but took his patient's hand. The
pulse still throbbed, but so faintly it was scarce perceptible.
For some time, perhaps a quarter of an hour,
they all watched in dead silence. The day faded fast,
and presently a small lamp was lighted by the Doctor.
The dying girl once more opened her eyes, which had
been so long closed all thought she had gone, but feared
to express their opinion. Again her lips moved. Ellen
pressed close to her, but failed to catch the words. The
flickering flame of life hovered long;&mdash;they "thought her
dying when she slept, and sleeping when she died." So
passively passed away her soul, her form had long grown
cold ere they knew she was gone. Not a sigh, not a
word, not a breath told the exact moment she ceased
to exist! It was on a night as calm as her spirit she
died,&mdash;and thus tranquilly ended a short, but latterly
embittered life.</p>

<p>It is impossible to paint the grief of the surviving
mourners; as they stood round the bed where she lay so
lifelike they could scarce believe her dead. The "hectic
streak" still tinged her face, and a smile so placid that
it seemed as if it lingered there to tell the mourners how
the disembodied soul was blessed.</p>

<p>"She is happy now," said the Countess; "we should
not grieve over her as if we had no hope; but we have
a blessed certainty she is happy."</p>

<p>But though she said so, Ellen's heart was too full, and
she gave way to a passionate flood of tears, as she kissed
the placid cheek of the dead.</p>

<p>We need say no more, save that the loved remains
were laid in their coffin bed, the waxlike arms closed
crosswise over her breast, and a white rose laid between
them. The lid was then screwed down, and the coffin
sent to the Towers, where with becoming solemnity she
was laid beside her sister.</p>

<p>The Earl and Countess and their companions started
for England, and after the funeral of Lady Florence remained
in perfect seclusion for many months at the
Towers. Grief often follows grief, and woe comes on
woe, as billows roll on billows, and smite the rocks.
Scarcely had the Earl and Countess recovered from the
grief of Florence's death, when the scarlet fever broke
out at the Towers, and seized both of their children.
Augusta passed safely through it, but it assumed a more
malignant guise with little Viscount de Vere, and with
fearful rapidity crushed its victim, leaving the poor
Countess almost heartbroken. She looked on Augusta
as her last hope left, and the culture of her opening mind
seemed almost the only object worth living for, excepting
her husband, who was utterly stricken by the death
of his sister and their only son, and needed indeed a
loving wife like Ellen to soothe his sorrow. Faithfully
did she fulfil her vows to love him in sickness and in
health, for better and for worse!</p>

<p>Mr. Lennox, about seven years after the events we
narrated in the last chapter, was sitting in his drawing-room
with several of his children, as well as his grandchildren,
around him. Louisa, whom we recollect at
the picnic, we should have before stated had succeeded
in captivating our friend Mr. Scroop, of Scroop Hall,
and rejoiced her lord's heart already with two little
Scroops, who promised to prove chips off the old block.
Both she, her husband, and the two boys were present,
as were also two other married daughters, and the only
son, a wild but amiable young fellow at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Lennox had lost his partner in life
since we last saw him, the world evidently had run
smoothly with him. Through the Earl's interest he had
obtained a very lucrative appointment in the Register
House, in the Sasines office, and though his hair was
sprinkled with snow, otherwise he was the same comfortable
looking, self-satisfied man; proud of himself,
his house, his hospitality, his children and now grandchildren.
He had managed to get off three of his
six daughters, one had died a few years ago, and one
was engaged to a young Baronet; the youngest, and
best looking he destined for some still higher lover!
Indeed, Caroline was worthy a better lot than awaited
her. She was tall and elegant in figure; her dark hair
almost black, brilliant eyes and high colour gave an air
of more than dashing beauty to her face. To this she
added the accomplishments of singing and requisite
artistic talents, besides possessing winning manners, wit
and talent in conversation. Mr. Lennox considered her
the flower of his family, the golden cord to his seven-stringed
lyre, of which one string was only as yet broken;
he was never tired of showing off the painting and drawings
of his daughter,&mdash;he was anxious to bring her out
on every occasion, and took care that everybody heard
and admired her singing, her conversation, and her
personal charms. Of William his son he was also vain
to a degree, and in his bringing up had totally neglected
all proper discipline, or inculcating a style of economy in
living at all commensurate with his means. The consequence
was at seventeen young Lennox was a conglomeration
of personal conceit&mdash;vanity of dress&mdash;and
dogmatical pedantry. From his father he had inherited
a pleasing exterior, had been crammed with learning
from his infancy; and, from all he had heard of the way
the young De Veres had behaved when they excited the
wonder and envy of all the country round, he had imbibed
the idea it was a grand thing to be fast, and so
he had shaped his course, quite forgetting he wanted the
means to be so, and already he was deep in the secrets
of the Jews, and all the vices of juvenile depravity.
When his follies were told to his father he would say,
"William is adolescent yet&mdash;when he grows matured in
years he will become wiser. The Earl of Wentworth was
also fast when young, but he is now quite sobered down&mdash;every
young man must sow his wild oats."</p>

<p>"Yo, ho! what a dull hole this is!" exclaimed William
Lennox, yawning. "What on earth shall I do with myself?
Ha! I know, I shall go and see Mrs. Siddons
act."</p>

<p>"William, my son, I fear the stage has too great
allurements for your mind! but still I can fancy you
must find this dulness intolerable. At any rate you will
be earlier to-night, won't you, my boy?"</p>

<p>"I'll see, governor&mdash;don't wait up for me; I've got
a pass key," and the young man sauntered from the
room, leaving the rest to amuse themselves without him.</p>

<p>"I am afraid William gets to no good at that theatre,"
said Scroop. "What a state he came home in last night!
he'll ruin his constitution if he goes on so."</p>

<p>"He is but a boy&mdash;he will grow wiser in time&mdash;poor
fellow, I do feel for him!" said his father.</p>

<p>"You should check it while he is young; look at
John de Vere: it was just that way he began his course,"
said Scroop again.</p>

<p>"I hope you do not think my dear William will
turn out so utterly degraded as that most unfortunate
and evil principled young man! Poor William! it is
only a little harmless extravagance I can blame him for
yet."</p>

<p>"Little beginnings you know; watch the first sign
of decay, stop the earliest symptoms of decline."</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard any tidings of that singular
character?&mdash;he was the most dark-minded, mysterious
man I ever met in all my travels," said Mr. Lennox,
anxious to change the conversation.</p>

<p>"The Earl has I believe caused every inquiry to be
made, but up till now without any result. The last,
you know, that was ever heard of them was their sailing
in a terrific snow-storm from Leith. I say them,
for I need no longer hide the fact that the Count
Czinsky was none other than Edward L'Estrange."</p>

<p>"You astonish me. Why did you never let this
transpire before? does the Earl know it?"</p>

<p>"He does not; to tell the truth my promise not to
let this out was an extorted one, and I consider myself
no longer bound to keep it, especially as there is little
doubt that both of them have long since paid the debt
of nature, and no doubt secured a fearful reckoning
with their Maker. Certainly that Weird in the family is
a wonderful thing! At first I doubted it&mdash;but now we
have the evidence of our own senses! Only the Earl left!
Lady Arranmore burned at nineteen, Lady Florence
dead of consumption at almost the same age, Frank de
Vere killed in India at the head of his men gallantly
cutting his way through the enemy, and the Captain,
as far as we know, drowned years ago! The Earl is
young yet, and if he does die so I shall think it the
most marvellous curse."</p>

<p>"The untimely fates of that family," said Louisa,
"have quite cast a gloom on the Old Towers: the
Earl has not been there since the funeral of his son:
he has become quite a foreigner. I think he always
lives at Naples now."</p>

<p>"How I should like to do so," said Caroline; "that
charming Naples&mdash;it is my day dream to see it some
day. Do you not think, papa, we should make the
tour some winter when you have your leave?"</p>

<p>"I should certainly like nothing better, Carry. We
have travelled&mdash;let me see&mdash;through France, Germany,
Prussia, the Rhine and Switzerland, Italy alone remains;
we shall see, darling. Some day perhaps I may take my
Caroline to show the Italian donnas what an English
beauty is."</p>

<p>"Louisa, love," said Scroop, "our little boys should
be off to bed&mdash;shouldn't they?"</p>

<p>"I will take them upstairs, and then we can have
some music or play cards. I wish William would
stay more at home! Come, dears, it's time to say good-night
to grandpapa."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the young Hopefuls departed with their
mother than the post came in, and a foreign letter
arrived for Mr. Lennox. He broke the seal, and read it
with an expression of great joy on his face.</p>

<p>"Whenever we converse about our friends we are sure
to hear about them. Here's a letter from Lord Wentworth,
in which he says, as he knows I generally take a
tour during my winter's vacation, he hopes I will pay
him a visit at Foggia, where he is now residing, a lovely
place in Capitanata. He wishes us to come by Naples,
as he trusts I will bring one or more of my family. I
am sure this is most considerate and kind. As I require
amusement after my toilsome labours as much as
William does after his Cambridge term, I shall most
decidedly accept for myself, William, who must see the
world, and my little Carry; you will come, won't you,
my darling?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be so delighted&mdash;I did so wish to see
Italy!"</p>

<p>"And then, my love, think under what auspicious
circumstances we shall see it with the Earl, and that
will give us an introduction to the best society there!"</p>

<p>"I fancy Foggia cannot boast of much society&mdash;the
Earl is quite retired now I hear," said Scroop. "However,
it is an interesting town&mdash;there is the Cathedral,
with the famous image of the Virgin, the gates of
Frederick's palace, and there Manfred won his victory.
Then, on the way, you see Naples. By-the-by
though, you pass the Val di Bovino&mdash;the haunt of all
the brigands! you will have to take care of them!"</p>

<p>"Oh! we shall have no need to fear them. I and
William armed cap-&agrave;-pie&mdash;and the postilions and all,
will be enough to scare them."</p>

<p>"Don't be over sure, and take some sbirri with you,
I advise you; there is Luigi Vardarelli, the great chief
there, and his band is so powerful he will stop whole
tribes of peasants, and rob them of their cattle and
gold."</p>

<p>"Ha! he will find William and me different metal,
if the rascal tries to stop us!"</p>

<p>In this way they all talked on till late. William
Lennox was still absent, and the lady part of the family
retired, whilst Mr. Lennox and Scroop sat up to let
him in. They had a long watch, for it was only after
three had struck the young worthy made his appearance
in a horrid state of intoxication. Mr. Lennox was
really much concerned, and annoyed at this <i>expos&eacute;</i> of
his favourite to his own son-in-law, however, he got his
poor boy to bed as quietly as possible, and himself
sought Morpheus's charms.</p>

<p>Young Lennox was well pleased when he next morning
heard the plan, and declared he would give the
Italian robbers cause to know he had not been under
Angelo in vain, should they risk an encounter. In a
few weeks another letter in answer to Mr. Lennox's
acceptance was received, in which the Earl pressed him
to come immediately; they were quite alone, excepting
the Marquis, who was paying the Countess and himself
a visit. In conclusion, he begged Mr. Lennox to call at
the Towers and give an enclosed note to old Andrew,
who would give him a jewel-case of the Countess's, who
was anxious to have them for the spring at Rome; he
begged him not to let Luigi, the terror of the Capitanata,
get hold of the jewels, and also impressed on his friend
the necessity of taking an escort of sbirri on the road
from Naples to Foggia. Mr. Lennox was certainly
somewhat alarmed at these notices, and almost determined
to leave Caroline behind; but the young lady so
coaxed her father to let her go, he at last consented,
saying only, if she was run off with, and became Luigi's
bride, it was not his fault. The romantic girl was quite
ready to run any risk for the pleasure of seeing Naples
and Italy, and William was quite wild in his anxiety to
show off his fencing, and almost began to wish an encounter
with this celebrated bandit.</p>

<p>Early in December, Mr. Lennox, his son, and youngest
daughter started in a vessel from Leith bound for Naples,
carrying with him the case of jewellery, which was somewhat
larger than he imagined, and from old Andrew's
special caution not to let his eye off it, seemed to be of
immense value. He was rather sorry he had been
chosen to carry them, and could not help wishing the
Earl had selected any other person in the world but
himself. Nothing unusual happened on their voyage.
They had rough weather in the Channel, rougher in the
Bay of Biscay, and roughest in the Mediterranean,
which Mr. Lennox had assured his children would be
like a millpond. None of them proved very good
sailors, and they were all delighted when Vesuvius
appeared and they came to rest in the Porto Grande.
Two or three days at Naples quite re-invigorated them
after their stormy passage, and they made all the excursions
that travellers generally make; saw the galleries,
the lions of the city, walked every evening along the
Villa Reale, and were quite charmed with the foreign
aspect of the place, the costumes of the peasants, and
white houses along the whiter sands edging the dark blue
Mediterranean. They were also disgusted with the
lazzaroni beggars, passport officials, and the extreme
dirtiness of the back streets, as well as broiled by the
sun. The vettura corriere, or mail coach, started at
midnight for Otranto, and as it passed Foggia, Mr.
Lennox determined to take it so far. At midnight, accordingly,
he and his party appeared at the coach office
to secure places; unfortunately, though they got their
places and were comfortably settled, some passengers for
Taranto, Bari, and other places still further on the
route, also arrived, and they were accommodated with
seats, whilst Mr. Lennox, his son, and Caroline in the
most surly manner were bid to alight and informed they
could not be taken. Mr. Lennox stormed, swore, and
threatened the English ambassador should be consulted,
and a hundred other calamities occur for stopping him
and turning him out in this unjustifiable way. It was all
to no purpose,&mdash;their baggage was tossed out, and the
mail drove off. After a good deal of fighting, Mr. Lennox
managed to get his fares refunded, and a couple of
hours later drove off in a hired vehicle with four horses
and two postilions. At Marigliano our travellers stopped
for breakfast, spending a couple of hours in seeing what
was to be seen. They again started off with fresh horses
to Cardinale, a small village at the foot of the mountains;
here they took advantage of a miserable table d'hote,
and gladly set off again up the steep hill-side.
First a valley was crossed full of vineyards and nut trees,
besides orchards filled with apples and other fruits,
above them spread dense chestnut forests. Crossing a
deep ravine, their carriage slowly climbed a tremendous
ascent, from the top of which they commanded a grand
view of the wide plains of Lavoro, till at last they rested
half an hour at Monteforte, and thence began the descent
to Avellino through a narrow valley, with the hills on
either side thickly wooded with nut trees. Soon they
saw the poplar rows which told them their first day's
labours were over, and they gladly put up at a far more
comfortable inn than they had yet seen since they left
Naples. Young Lennox took a stroll through the town,
and declared he saw more beauty than he had ever seen
in one evening before all his life. Indeed they had an
excellent example of the famous beauty of the women of
Avellino in the daughter of their host, a most perfect
Italian beauty, who might have sat for the Madonna della
Seggiola. Early next morning they breakfasted with
all the travellers by the vettura, which had also rested
there the first night. During the meal a good deal was
said about the celebrated banditti that then haunted
the Val di Bovino.<a name="FNanchor_C_" id="FNanchor_C_"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_" title="See Note K. Val di Bovino." class="fnanchor">[C]</a> The most wondrous stories of the
power and prowess of Luigi Vardarelli were freely conversed
on, and Mr. Lennox began quite to wish himself
at home again. His son professed to discredit them,
and declared his feats must be grossly exaggerated.
After their morning meal, a smart drive up the hilly but
romantic road brought them to Dentecane; thence they
drove to the Grotto Minarda, situate in the middle of
cornfields, where they lunched, and then passed on past
Ariano, also celebrated for its female beauty, to Savignano,
which they reached as the light began to
decline, having loitered a good deal by the road. Here
nothing but the name of Luigi filled every mouth, and
the landlord, anxious to detain customers, assured them
it was madness to think of passing through the Val di
Bovino that night, as they would certainly be attacked.
Having no wish to come to close quarters with the desperados,
Mr. Lennox and his daughter readily obliged
their host by staying, and William was fain, much against
his will, to rest there too. It was a miserable post house&mdash;one
which is now totally disused,&mdash;but the Italian
landlord did everything to try and make the evening
pleasant, and his daughter, a fine, handsome young girl
of twenty, was quite in William's way, and he talked
his best Italian to her, whilst his father and sister
listened to their host's tales of horror about the two
Vardarelli, till they almost trembled with fear. Shortly
after their dinner a horseman rode up to the inn, and,
dismounting, said he would stay there for the night.
Our host left his friends, and was busy introducing his
new arrival to the remains of the table d'hote served up
as new. The traveller, however, appeared exceedingly
moderate in his tastes, and hardly touched anything.
Mr. Lennox and Caroline could not help occasionally
turning their eyes on the new guest; he was short and
very slight in form, but his face was perfect; a slightly
arched, finely chiselled nose, dark, piercing eyes, and
well-made mouth, gave quite a poetic cast to his features,
which his long black hair and melancholy countenance
fully kept up. He seemed agitated and flushed, as if
he had either met with some disaster, or was travelling
at an unwonted speed. Mr. Lennox, after he had seen
his wants satisfied, with English bonhomie asked him
if he would not join their table, and drink wine together?
After a little hesitation the invitation was accepted, the
young man's melancholy quickly passed away before the
social glass, and he began laughing and talking like any
of them. He seemed well-educated and connected, and
by-and-by let out he was a Count Cesare, who lived
near Foggia, knew the Wentworths well, and had just
started from their villa at Foggia towards Naples. He
said he had been chased by some of the notorious brigands
nearly up to the inn yard, and that might account
for his excited conduct when he first arrived. The ice being
once broken, Mr. Lennox, like all Englishmen, told his
new acquaintance his whole history in a couple of hours;
how he was an intimate friend of Lord Wentworth; was
then going to see him, and carrying valuable jewellery.</p>

<p>The Count praised his judgment in not proceeding
further that night, advised him to place the jewellery in
the trunk-box of his carriage, and not to carry it inside
as he had been doing, and, above all, charged him not
to trust the sbirri, who, he said, were usually confederate
with the banditti, and even if not were worthless
cowards. He said he could recommend two young men
who were relatives of their host, who would accompany
them next day through the valley into the Apulian
plains as far as Pozzo d'Alberto; thence it was only ten
miles to their destination. Mr. Lennox thanked his
friend much, and willingly followed his advice. The
two young men were introduced by their host, and
looked well able to defend their charge, armed as they
were with pistols and stilettos. Mr. Lennox also took
pistols, and his son carried a sword, so they were well
prepared at least, and the Count told them they would
probably have no need of weapons, only prevention was
better than cure. Mutually pleased, they separated for
their different apartments, bestowing their praises on
the accommodation, Mr. Lennox to dream of the Earl's
reception of him and his children, William of the fair
Giulia with whom he had lost his heart, Caroline of
brigands, and the Count, as he called himself, not to
dream, but to think what a gull he had got hold of in
Mr. Lennox! Count Cesare was in fact only a member
of the Vardarelli's band, who had thus gleaned all the
information he wanted for Luigi, and left two of his
men to act the part of guardians. The landlord and his
daughter Giulia were old hands at their trade, and
would probably share their guest's plunder.</p>

<p>Early next morning, after a most unpleasant night,
owing to the musquitoes and other insects that prevented
them from almost closing their eyes, our travellers arose,
little dreaming what was in store for them. They were
disappointed to find that their friend, the Count, had
left for Naples at an early hour&mdash;so he bade the inn-keeper
say&mdash;as they had anticipated his pleasant company
at breakfast. Mr. Lennox then had to pay a most
extortionate charge, notwithstanding his utmost efforts
to reduce it. William after actually prevailing on his
inamorata to bestow a parting salute, buckled on his
sword, loosened it in the scabbard, and felt himself a
hero. The two false guards mounted behind. Mr.
Lennox handed his daughter into the carriage, and after
his son, who talked loud of his hopes for a brush with
the miscreants, got in himself also, the postilions whipped
up and began the steep descent into the Val di Bovino,
shortly after leaving Montaguto.</p>

<p>The early sun was bright and warm, the air clear, the
scenery exquisite; every one felt in grand spirits as they
trotted down the narrow defile through cornfields and
hemp-fields, with the river Cervaro gushing by. Soon the
mountains, so steep as to seem inaccessible, closed nearer
in, dense woods on either side of acacia and other trees
almost shut out the daylight. When they were perhaps
more than half way through, a pistol-shot resounded
through the woods! In an instant the postilions drew
up their horses with a loud cry&mdash;"The bandits&mdash;the
bandits&mdash;the Vardarelli&mdash;we are undone!"<a name="FNanchor_D_" id="FNanchor_D_"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_" title="See Note L. The Vardarelli." class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>"Drive on, drive on, for the love of heaven," cried Mr.
Lennox, pale with fear&mdash;but his voice was unheard.</p>

<p>Another pistol-shot resounded, and this close by; its
aim was fatal to the foremost postilion, who fell a corpse
off his terrified horse. The other man leapt down and
fled into the woods like a hare. William leapt out too,
and drawing his sword whirled it round his head, crying
to their guards to fight, to do their duty, and defend his
sister! Alas! the guards were not there&mdash;they too had
disappeared! He now looked despairingly for aid; his
father, poor old man, was white as a sheet, and trembling
with fear held the pistol cocked in one hand, and supported
Caroline, who was in a dead swoon, in the other.
The postilions&mdash;one was dead, the other flown! What
should he do to save his family from their as yet unseen
foe? A thought struck him, he would drive on! Just
as he was about to put his thought into execution, and
drive on the horses, which stood as if petrified too&mdash;a
confused sound of trampling of steeds&mdash;oaths of men,
clashing of arms&mdash;rose on every side, and as if by magic
the carriage was surrounded by at least forty brigands.
One, a dark-looking man, but evidently not a native,
was conspicuous from the coal-black steed he bestrode,
and his commanding manner. This was Luigi Vardarelli.
Near him rode another singularly resembling him: this
was Adrian Vardarelli; he saw another there he least
expected to see&mdash;their friend the Count, of last evening!
Close to this man rode two others, their quondam
guardians! The remaining robbers were all fierce,
bloodthirsty looking men. All this was seen in a moment
by the unfortunate youth. He saw they were betrayed&mdash;he
saw his death was near&mdash;and with a high resolve we
could scarcely have thought the young man capable of
feeling, he determined to try and save his father and
sister by self-devotion.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," he cried in Italian, "you could not hurt
my aged parent, nor helpless sister! I think too highly
of you&mdash;you are too noble to do so! take all we have&mdash;take
me&mdash;and have your vengeance on my head, but
spare my father,&mdash;spare my sister! You too, sir," addressing
the false Count, "who have shared our hospitality,
turn not your hand against them."</p>

<p>Adrian Vardarelli seemed moved by the young man's
speech, and said something in his favour to the chieftain;
but alas! in his face there was not the shadow of
mercy. He said something aside to the false Count,
who advancing, leapt off his horse and gave a command
in Italian to the two who had been their guards, who
instantly cutting the traces, smote the liberated horses,
which set off at full speed, leaving the carriage alone on
the road. The bandit then walking up struck the unfortunate
young Lennox a blow on his cheek with the
side of his sword, and commanded him to draw. Smarting
with the blow, which drew blood, and still more with
the insult, William rushed on his cool, wary antagonist
with blind fury. The conflict was short; all Angelo's
tuition went for nothing against the robber, who was a
master in the art of fencing. In less than three passes
he disarmed his foe, and stepping forward ran his
vengeful blade through and through William Lennox's
heart! Then wiping the blade on his fallen victim's
clothes, he walked to his captain for further orders.</p>

</div></div>


<p>From the time he heard the first shot up to the
moment he saw his son pierced by the brigand's weapon,
Mr. Lennox had sat as if he was an effigy and not a
man, the father of him who had nobly died for him, and
the senseless girl who had sunk against him in a swoon.
Whether it was abject fear, or whether he was stunned
by the horrid murder of his son and the fainting state of
Caroline, or whether both preyed on the old man's
mind we know not, but certain it is he sat as if powerless,
insensible, crushed.</p>

<p>"To work, comrades," cried the captain of the band;
"you, my Pedro, have ably spun yon fiery coxcomb, but
more remains to be done. Pedro, lay a hand on the
jewels, you know where they lie. I myself will see what
the old dotard is about."</p>

<p>Whilst Pedro hastened to the trunk where the jewels
were hidden, Luigi dismounted; followed by Adrian and
several others, he approached the carriage-door. Roused
for an instant from his fearful lethargy, Mr. Lennox
aimed the pistol he held in his hand at the first
intruder's head, and fired, narrowly missing Luigi, who
little expected such a welcome. As it was, the smoke
so clouded him, suffocating him with its sulphurous
vapour, that for an instant he was as it were knocked
back.</p>

<p>"The old devil! who would have thought of
that? Iddio! I had a narrow escape: the rascal! he
shall suffer for it!" exclaimed the irate chieftain, as he
rushed forward at the old gentleman, who had after
this sudden outburst again relapsed into dastardly inaction.
"You old viper! I've got you now, and by
Heaven I'll teach you to fire at me that way! here,
Adrian, help us to drag the venomous old toad from his
hole."</p>

<p>Without waiting for the assistance he asked, Luigi,
seizing the old man by the shoulder, dragged him forth
notwithstanding his cries for mercy.</p>

<p>"Pity my grey hairs! pity a father you have left sonless!
spare me, oh! gentlemen, for God's sake! mercy!
misericordia! for the sake of God&mdash;for the Virgin!"</p>

<p>"Cease whining in your villainous Italian, and ask for
mercy in good English, you drivelling old poltroon,"
cried Luigi, in that tongue, for he had hitherto spoken in
Italian.</p>

<p>He still held his prostrate foe by the arm with an
iron grip, menacing death with his naked dagger. Had
it not been for the dire reality and fatal signs of murder
around, there was something almost ludicrous in the
scene. Lying on his back, with his grey hair tangled
and torn by his rough usage, his hands clasped together
in beseeching agony, tears of terror streaming down his
face, his countenance betraying awful fright, Mr.
Lennox presented a remarkable contrast to the stern
brigand, who, kneeling with one knee on his fallen
captive, played with a shining dagger in one hand,
whilst with the other he held his prisoner firm. The
robber's countenance showed mingled contempt for his
antagonist, if a resistless prisoner may so be called, and
joy at having thus a foe in his power. But the scene
was too terribly bloody for a smile; the father's foot
rested against the body of his dead son, a little further
off lay the corpse of the postilion with his limbs drawn
together in the agony of his dying struggle, whilst fierce
men on all sides cursed and swore as they dragged forth
the baggage from the carriage, rudely breaking the
lids, and scattering the articles on the road in their
search for gold or precious things. Some of the band
stood mute admirers of the scene of carnage and rapine,
others were passionless lookers on, whilst one appeared
to regard with horror the whole outrage. This solitary
instance amongst a band infamous for its butcheries was
Adrian Vardarelli. Leaning against his horse from which
he had dismounted, he regarded the various incidents
with a look approaching to disgust,&mdash;once when he saw
the face of Mr. Lennox as he was torn from his carriage,
this look changed to one of intense surprise; but again
he reposed into his former state of indolent disapproval.
When Mr. Lennox heard his native tongue spoken
where he least expected it, and by one he least
imagined to know it, a sudden feeling of joy thrilled
through him.</p>

<p>An Englishman, then, the captain of the band was, he
knew it by his accent; he knew that some of the fiercest
brigands had been his countrymen, but he felt a conviction,
bad as he was, brutal as was his conduct, there was
yet an appeal to his mercy as a fellow countryman, and
he would try if there was not in his black heart a chord
that responded.</p>

<p>"Capitano," he cried, "I am an Englishman, so are you.
Oh! for the sake of our mutual land&mdash;for the love of God
and man&mdash;for the sake of England, your native home,&mdash;spare
me, spare my daughter; take my money, take all,
but save my life."</p>

<p>"Look at me, you cowardly old rascal, look at me; do
you not know me? then ask yourself if you have cause
to expect mercy; no, by G&mdash; I told you a reckoning
time would come, it has come, and d&mdash;n me if I let it
slip."</p>

<p>It is not in the power of language to tell the surprise
of Mr. Lennox, as he gazed on the speaker, and in
Luigi Vardarelli, the terror of the Capitanata, the
scourge of the Abruzzi and all the south of Italy, beheld
his old acquaintance Captain John de Vere.</p>

<p>"Ha! Lennox, old boy," continued the robber,
"you little thought Luigi Vardarelli was your old
friend the Captain. Egad I little thought, when Pedro
brought me the news to-day an old gentleman, his son
and daughter, with rich jewels, passed this way, that it
was my old friend Lennox. I told you a dozen years
ago you might live to repent your words to me that
night; you have lived to do so, and by the Almighty you
shall repent it,&mdash;your life alone shall satisfy me."</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Lennox, who had been comforting himself
with the hopes that old friendship would at least save
his life, saw all his visions vanish like smoke with the
last dreadful words; yet he determined he would not
lose his life for want of asking. During their converse
the Captain had let his unfortunate prisoner loose from
the iron grip with which he had till then detained him,
and now stood calmly scrutinizing his suppliant.</p>

<p>"Oh, Captain de Vere, noble Captain de Vere, for
the sake of old friendship, spare me, for the sake of the
Earl, your departed sister, have pity on me, an aged,
helpless man. Why should you take my life? I have
done you no harm; leave me to finish my life in peace;
spare me to my daughter. Oh! you have had your
revenge in slaying my son, the hope of my age. Oh!
stay your sword."</p>

<p>"Name not your son in the same breath with your
abject supplications; he died a man, he had some pluck
in him, but sirrah! you are a disgrace to your name&mdash;a
disgrace to Britain, and all your entreaties will not move
me. I will hang you on the next tree and rid the
world of such a poltroon."</p>

<p>"Then if you have no mercy in your black heart&mdash;if
you have no natural pity in your reptile blood&mdash;hear me
as an Englishman. I tell you a heavy retribution will
fall on you if you shed my blood. I am a Briton, and
His Majesty's liege subject. I am his special servant;
dread him, bold robber, he will send his armies and root
such accursed bloodthirsty wolves from this country."</p>

<p>"Ha, you speak very fine, my brave fellow, but I
scorn your threats as much as your entreaties. I have
long renounced my allegiance to your besotted king;
here his armies and navies are alike useless: besides, my
bravo, who will tell his most sacred Majesty that his
servant hangs like a felon on a nut-tree? But egad,
we waste time arguing with a cowardly old miscreant
like this. Pedro, swing him up on yon tree."</p>

<p>"You dare not&mdash;oh heavens! you dare not&mdash;the Earl&mdash;the
King&mdash;oh, no, no," embracing the very hessians of
the bandit. "Captain de Vere, for auld lang syne,
pardon me, I know not what I say, hang me not like a
dog."</p>

<p>"As you are one, that were no great fault; but perhaps
you wish a little torture first. Pedro, Antonio,
twist the rope round his forehead first, till his eyes start
a little."</p>

<p>"Good God! you surely joke, you would not, you
could not do so," exclaimed the unfortunate man, as he
saw these desperados approach to fulfil their master's
order.</p>

<p>"I joke not," replied the Captain; "you think I am a
woman, and turn pale at the sight of blood. I have not
been pirate and bandit a dozen years for nothing, by
G&mdash;. I have not roamed torrid and temperate zone,
or pitched shiploads of niggers into the sea to grow sick
at a little bloodshed, or merciful because an old coward
asks for mercy. I have seen a dozen better men than
thee, old dotard, tortured and beheaded, and think you
I joke; ye gods, you will find me another man than you
think. Did you hear me, sirrahs? do my bidding, or Iddio!
I'll serve you the same. And hark you, if he
chatters for mercy any more, tear his vile tongue out
by the roots."</p>

<p>These awful commands would doubtless have been
carried out to the letter had not Adrian, or, as our
readers must have already guessed, Edward L'Estrange,
then stepped forward, and pleaded for an old friend.</p>

<p>"Nay, Luigi, hurt not the poor old imbecile, he is not
worth your interest. Hands off, villains!" (to the two
ruffians who were about to begin their work of butchery).
"Heed them not, old man, I will not let them harm you,
for the sake of old and better days."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Edward L'Estrange, you had ever a
feeling heart! God bless you for befriending an old,
and friendless man, who has fallen among thieves!
God be merciful to you for saving a poor fellow
creature's life!" exclaimed the poor man when his
tormentors departed.</p>

<p>The Captain bit his lips. "You were ever a soft-hearted
fool, and would be better occupied in wooing
your lady-love, or in writing sonnets to another's bride,
than aiding in any manly exploit; but, hark you, I
will spare only his tortures&mdash;not his life. He fired
at me, and by heaven he dies for it! I am captain here,
no one shall countermand my orders."</p>

<p>"Edward L'Estrange, for the love of God, say something
for me."</p>

<p>"I can do no more; he is captain. God knows if I
was, your blood should not stain my hand; be thankful
I have saved you from torture."</p>

<p>Poor Lennox thought he had small cause for thankfulness.</p>

<p>"Are we to loiter here all day? By heavens, my
comrades! heard you ever such a noise about an old fool's
life before? Egad, one would think there were two
captains here. Every command is reversed! Which
will you have as a leader&mdash;Adrian or me? Which will
do most for you&mdash;he or I? Whom will you obey?
By G&mdash;, it's time there was some understanding."</p>

<p>"You, you, you shall be our chief, <i>al diavolo</i> with
Adrian, the faint-hearted fool!" exclaimed Pedro; all
the rest assented.</p>

<p>"Then obey me only," said the Captain; "we shall
have the sbirri here in half an hour more, unless we come
to quarters. Here, hang, shoot, strangle, or behead yon
rascally dotard&mdash;which will you have, Lennox? there's
store of deaths, choose away and be sharp! You are
dumb, are you? Then I'll choose for you. Antonio cut
his head off, and stick it on a pole; he ever soared high,
he shall be higher after death than before it. Toss that
carrion into the ravine," pointing to the postilion, "and
whip off that lad's head, too, and stick it on a pole opposite
his father's; and now for the girl."</p>

<p>We turn our backs on the scene that followed, and shut
our ears to the heart-rending cries for mercy. Enough
to say in less time than we have taken to write this, the
heads of the unhappy father and son were cut off, and
whilst the bleeding trunks were left as they lay, the
ghastly heads were stuck on two poles, and elevated on
either side of the road.</p>

<p>Turning a deaf ear and merciless eye to the butchery,
the Captain approached the carriage, on the floor of
which the hapless Caroline lay in a dead faint.</p>

<p>"Ha! not ill-looking by any means. Come, my girl,
cheer up," applying some brandy to her nose, whilst
another robber flung some water on the senseless girl's
face. These restoratives had the desired effect, and the
poor girl opened her eyes; at the same time crying out,
"My poor father, is he alive? Oh! spare him, noble
sirs!"</p>

<p>"He is well&mdash;that is the old man&mdash;and will remain
so if his daughter will be Luigi's bride," said the hard-hearted
Captain.</p>

<p>"Oh, God be thanked&mdash;but my brother?"</p>

<p>"Heed not him, come away; here Pedro, Adrian,
you were ever a lady's man, give this girl a swing on my
horse, and take her down to the cave; she will do to
drive away my hours of ennui."</p>

<p>L'Estrange stooped down and lifted her in his arms:
taking her out of the carriage, he let her slowly fall
down from his arms till her feet touched the ground;
he turned her head away from the poles with their
ghastly heads. His face betrayed convulsive emotions,
as if he was planning something within.</p>

<p>"Why burden yourself with her, Capitano?" said Pedro,
"there are fairer girls than she in Avellino; she will be
a burden, and ever moping and crying, like your last
Inglese girl."</p>

<p>"You speak sooth, d&mdash;n me if you don't. What do
I want with the pigeon? Wring her neck, and let's be off
with our booty."</p>

<p>"Luigi," said L'Estrange, for by that name he had
long learned to address him, "you have had your way
with the old man&mdash;you have dipped your hands already
in innocent blood&mdash;leave this girl to me, let her be my
prize."</p>

<p>As he spoke these words poor Caroline had detected
the cruel reality, and, giving a wild scream as she glanced
towards the fatal poles and their dreadful burdens, again
swooned and sunk down on the ground at her protector's
feet.</p>

<p>"You chicken-hearted fool, you were ever a blockhead
when women fell in your way, but this girl is my
prize, and I'll do what I please with her. See, the silly
dove has gone and swooned again. Egad, you make a
nice pair. Come, Adrian, away with such folly; run
your dagger through her heart, and let's away, or we shall
bring the whole country buzzing about our ears."</p>

<p>"Protect me, sir; oh, protect me," cried Caroline,
awakening again from her swoon, and as if by instinct
seeing in him a deliverer.</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;fear not, maiden."</p>

<p>"Can you?" roared the Captain. "Are you able?
Ye powers! he dares me, his captain!"</p>

<p>"You are not my captain, I renounce my allegiance.
I have long been sickened by your brutalities. I wanted
but an excuse to shake off an accursed yoke. I am free;
henceforth I forsake your band. I will protect this girl.
Thank God, black as my heart is&mdash;dark as my crimes
have been&mdash;I have something human left still; let me
see who will touch her!"</p>

<p>Whilst he spoke these words a dark light beamed on
his face, his eyes seemed to flash fire; beneath him knelt
the poor girl, who had flown to him for protection,
around him scowled the brigands, struck dumb at this
sudden rebellion.</p>

<p>The Captain's very aspect darkened, as with a stern
voice he again asked, "Comrades, who is to be captain?&mdash;whose
is the girl?"</p>

<p>"Thou art&mdash;she is yours," exclaimed twenty voices.</p>

<p>"Then renounce your booty, give up your prize, obey
your chief! miscreant, fool, rebel, accursed and d&mdash;&mdash;d,
yield thee!" he shouted rather than spoke these words,
and, as he spoke, he advanced to where L'Estrange
stood.</p>

<p>Never did fierce tiger guard its prey as L'Estrange
did his suppliant; his whole frame trembled with passion,
his mouth quivered, his eyes rolled fire.</p>

<p>"Back on your life; tempt me not," he cried, in a voice
shuddering from wrath; "she is mine, I will guard her
to death&mdash;I will save her, I will; fear not, maiden."</p>

<p>As the dove trembles when the hawk approaches&mdash;as
the chicken hides beneath its mother's wing when the
kite poises above&mdash;so trembled Caroline, so did she crouch
beneath her protector, as the fierce Captain stepped
forward.</p>

<p>The rest of the brigands stood still in a circle round,
they were men, and they loved to see manly resistance;
it would be hard to tell which of the two had most
well-wishers. They saw L'Estrange was no coward, no
faint heart, although merciful. They knew the Captain's
character, and in silence watched. There was not one
there who would give unwarrantable assistance to either,&mdash;the
two must fight it out&mdash;they only looked on.</p>

<p>"Save <i>yourself</i>, Adrian, save yourself, L'Estrange; see
yonder come the troops," pointing down the vale, up
which came a large detachment of mounted sbirri;
"yet," laying his hand on Caroline's shoulder, whilst she
shrunk from his touch, "never shall it be said mortal
man bearded me living. I am captain, I will have my
lawful captive, and," lifting his bright dagger, "now
yield thee, give her up. I will be chief&mdash;nothing but
death shall make me yield my authority."</p>

<p>"Then die!" cried L'Estrange, striking a back-blow
at his enemy with his stiletto. It sunk beneath the
blade of the Captain's right shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, God! you have killed me, villain! oh, God! I
am done for!" ejaculated the unhappy man, as he sunk
backwards. At the same instant a dozen gunshots rent
the air, and the robbers were surrounded on every side
by enemies.</p>

<p>"What have I done?" exclaimed L'Estrange, gazing
at the ghastly face of the Captain. "I have killed him!
God forgive me!"</p>

<p>Then, throwing Caroline across the saddle-bow of his
horse which stood beside him, he himself mounted in
an instant, and, casting a hurried glance at the new foe
and his late comrades, struck his spurs into his courser's
flanks, and dashed through the sbirri, managing his horse
with his knees; holding Caroline with one hand, whilst
with the other he whirled his sabre over his head, cutting
his way right and left through the sbirri. A dozen
pistol-balls followed his flight from both friends&mdash;at
least former ones,&mdash;and enemies; but he seemed
charmed,&mdash;no bullet struck him, and he was soon beyond
range both of ball and vision.</p>

<p>The fight and its awful end had so engaged the
bandits, they did not mark the new enemy approach,
and gradually surround them: when, however, the first
shot was fired, and one of their band fell mortally
wounded, they were soon up and doing.</p>

<p>The two conflicts went on together for a few moments;
then the Captain fell, and the sbirri, seeing the champion
sink, rushed again on their foes with renewed energy.</p>

<p>The robbers were not men to be taken by surprise, as
the sbirri found to their cost. They were all mounted
in an instant; and the most of them, well acquainted
with the ground, which their antagonists were not, disappeared
in the woods, and from behind the trees kept
up a telling fire. Man after man dropped before the
unseen shots, and the few remaining soon began to lose
spirit. When their Captain fell, and Adrian galloped
off with his prize, a yell of vengeance arose from the
brigands; and one of joy from the sbirri. The former&mdash;at
least half a dozen who still remained&mdash;rushed to
protect him from the latter, who strove to gain possession
of the prize. A terrible hand-to-hand conflict was
fought over the wounded man, who laughed as he saw
them so grimly engage; for though mortally, he was only
wounded as yet, and might live many hours.</p>

<p>Several bullets were, as we have already said, fired
after the retreating L'Estrange. The battle still went
on over the Captain; the sbirri wavered,&mdash;they yielded,
and then fled. But they did not escape; every man was
shot or cut down, and not even one escaped alive to tell the
tale! The successful belligerents then took up their
wounded captain, as well as the plunder, and diving
into the woods, sought their cave, leaving five dead, and
carrying home four more wounded besides their chief
Luigi.</p>

<p>About half an hour after the conflict had ceased, and
the brigands were gone, a solitary figure emerged from
the woods, crossed himself when he saw the numerous
corpses, and the poles with their bleeding trophies, and
whistled, faintly at first, as if afraid of the reappearance
of the enemy, then louder. His whistle was answered
by plaintive neighs, and in less than ten minutes two of
the four horses trotted up to the postilion; by-and-by
a third also appeared; after some time he succeeded in
harnessing his horses to the despoiled carriage, and set
off alone for Foggia.</p>

<p>He had not proceeded far, however, ere the temporary
fastenings he had made gave way, and the carriage once
more came to a stand-still. The postilion alighted, and
then, giving the other horses their freedom, mounted
one, on which he galloped to the Earl's villa, bearing
with him a scarf dyed with blood which had belonged
to Caroline, as a dread token of the truth of his tale.</p>

<p>On his restless couch lay Captain John de Vere, the
dying brigand. He was mortally wounded, though the
deep gash had been bound, and the outward flow of
blood stayed, yet he felt a pang which told him the
wound bled internally, and he could not but feel it was
for his life. Death is a grand tryer; and when the bold
sinner felt that within him which, in unmistakeable
language, silently told him that in a few hours at most
he would quit a life of crime and bloodshed, and enter
on an endless existence of misery, or total annihilation,
(for he was a professed infidel,) even his stout heart
somewhat quailed! He felt the firm ground&mdash;the <i>terra
cognita</i>&mdash;giving way; the reed on which he held failing
him. He was about to make that dread leap in the
dark, and to appear before an offended Deity; for
though he professed to disbelieve in the existence of
God, his heart belied his voice. He was in a burning
fever&mdash;faint from loss of blood and parched with the
death-thirst!&mdash;he felt the slow trickle of his life-blood
inly welling! Oh! how his tongue seemed scorching,
as if a foretaste of the quenchless fires of hell! He turned
over on his side, a thrill of agony shot through him,
and he again relapsed to his former position, and lay on
his back. He had turned to see if there was any one
with him; he was alone, save his own dark thoughts,&mdash;they
were with him! The couch on which he lay was
raised on a slight bedstead that stood against the naked
rock-walls of the cave. The apartment itself was a small
cavern, opening into the larger cave in which the band
lived,&mdash;it was his own private cell!</p>

<p>It was dimly lighted by a single wax candle of large
dimensions, whose light counterfeited gloom on the dark
rocks, hung with weapons, which glimmered in the uncertain
rays. A large oaken table, very low, stood
in the centre of the cave; on it were placed several
bunches of grapes and a glass vessel of water,&mdash;but
beyond the sufferer's reach, tantalizing him with their
proximity. Oh, if he could reach the cooling fruit, and
still more cooling water!&mdash;it seemed to aggravate his
pain; and once more he made an effort to rise. This
time he sat upright, and experienced a certain relief
from the change of position; he gazed on the tempting
fruit; but when he further raised his form to strive and
reach it, another agonizing pang shot through him; so
intense was its poignancy he could scarcely forbear
screaming. He sank back a second time, muttering
curses on his band.</p>

<p>"They were ready enough to share my booty!&mdash;good
friends in health, but at need where are they? False
dogs! vile deceivers!&mdash;they leave me, their captain, to
perish like a brute beast! Bill! Pedro!&mdash;some one of you&mdash;dogs,
ingrates!&mdash;for the love of God a glass of water!"
The last part of the sentence was shouted. "They
hear me not&mdash;they care not for me!&mdash;but no, I wrong
them," he said, as the curtain which divided his cave
from the larger was pushed aside, and an Italian maiden
entered. She was very young, and singularly interesting-looking
in face; her beauty, of a high order, was as yet
imperfectly developed; her eyes large, dark, and piercing.
She approached the dying man with noiseless tread;
then in her soft tongue asked if he wanted anything.</p>

<p>"Yes, child, water&mdash;water!&mdash;for God's sake! I am
parched."</p>

<p>The maiden poured out a silver goblet-ful from the
glass vessel, and brought it to the sufferer; he seized it
as if it had been for his life, and eagerly drained it.</p>

<p>"Thanks; it is long since I tasted water, signorina, but
I never before drank wine with such gusto,&mdash;egad, it
was nectar!"</p>

<p>"Take some grapes, Capitano," said the girl, offering
him a bunch; "they will cool your tongue. Are you
better?&mdash;easier from pain?"</p>

<p>"Ay, better now," exclaimed the Captain, receiving
the fruit. "Now tell Bill Stacy I want him:&mdash;why
does he shrink from the sight of death?"</p>

<p>"He shrinks not from death, but has gone to bring
you a priest," said the girl. "The Virgin grant you
may yet live!"</p>

<p>She then as noiselessly departed, and once more left
the dying man to his own reflections.</p>

<p>His thoughts were far from enviable; he felt perhaps
remorse&mdash;for it was not repentance nor grief&mdash;for his
crimes; and as he recalled them all, the long dark
catalogue seemed endless,&mdash;terrific! Deeds of rapine
and murder long forgotten revived like adders, and
stung him once more;&mdash;but it was the agony of lost
despair&mdash;the echoes of horrid crimes!</p>

<p>From these thoughts he was roused by the entrance
of Bill Stacy, and with him a Roman Catholic priest.</p>

<p>"Ha! Bill! you are come at last. Egad! I thought
you had clean forgotten a wounded mate. But who the
devil have you got there? Where did you pick up yon
shaveling?&mdash;and why bring you accursed priests to my
bed?"</p>

<p>"Your cable is nigh run out; I thought you would
like a chaplain mayhap, and brought this fellow along&mdash;for
I had hard work to prevail on the cussed fool to
venture his head here;&mdash;but here he is; and he knows
a yarn o' long prayers!"</p>

<p>"My son," said the priest, looking heavenwards as he
crossed himself, "look on this blessed sign, and ere life
takes wing, ask the bless&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he was cut short by the Captain.</p>

<p>"Cease your drivelling&mdash;idiotical nonsense, or preach
to others who believe your fables. Egad, you think me
dying, but I'll come it yet. Away, old dotard!"</p>

<p>"Blaspheme not, my son; think upon the blessed
Virgin; think on him who forgave the dying thief."</p>

<p>"I, the dying thief! be d&mdash;d to you. Bill, if you
love me, chase the whining hypocrite from the cave.
God's name! had I the strength, I would break his
shaven pate for him."</p>

<p>"He don't want you, nor do I neither; so spread sail,
old monk, and look sharp our lads don't tear your frock
off your back or your hide off your old bones," said Bill,
pushing the priest unceremoniously from him by the
way he came in.</p>

<p>"What in the foul fiend's name brought you that
pattering shaven-headed rascal here for?"</p>

<p>"I told you, but howsomdever let it pass. What did
you want me for?"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Bill. I say, Bill, this cut isn't mortal,
is it?"</p>

<p>"There's small doubt of that: you are overhauled at
last. I bound it up, but the blood flows into your hold,
when it is full you will sink."</p>

<p>"You lie, sirrah! and yet&mdash;yet, I do feel queery.
D&mdash;n Ned for a villain; it was a cowardly felon-thrust.
You will avenge me, Bill, if I flit."</p>

<p>"I promise you. Our band will go to wreck now
when their skipper is gone."</p>

<p>"And yet, Bill, I may come it. I've escaped worse
than this."</p>

<p>"No you havn't; you won't ride out this squall.
You are wrecked at last, and on the shoals now."</p>

<p>"Go to the devil. You are a capital Job's comforter,
Bill," said the sinking sinner, trying to laugh.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking you will see him first. Gin there be a
devil he should give you a good berth, since you have
helped so many downwards. You'll know if there be a
hell or not this night."</p>

<p>For some time, as if exhausted by his exertions in
speaking, the Captain lay silent and motionless, save
that now and then, as if in agony, he ground his teeth
together or clenched the clothes between his fingers.
Old Bill sat silently watching him without a feature
moving. Again the dying Captain sat up, and passing
his hand over his eyes as if to clear his vision, said,
"Bill, the candle is going out&mdash;it is getting dark."</p>

<p>"It is your own candle going out, and the darkness
of death in your brain!"</p>

<p>"You lie, dog, it is false! and yet&mdash;yet how dark it
grows. The shadows pass quickly; ah! they're gone, I
see clear again; and now once more they come&mdash;it
grows dark, so dark! Bill, I'm dying&mdash;but get brandy,
I've heard it has do&mdash;ne won&mdash;" He sank back, unable
to articulate the final words.</p>

<p>Bill passed some of the burning spirit into his mouth
from a flask; its effect was rapid and wonderful. Once
more, fed by the ardent liquid which gave a short-lived
strength, and, as it were, nourished the flickering lamp
of life, the expiring man sat up.</p>

<p>"More, Bill, more! hurrah for brandy! More, I
say. Ha! I begin to see clearly again. More yet,
more! The shadows are gone; I feel new vigour. Ye
gods, I'll come it yet!"</p>

<p>Bill shook his head.</p>

<p>"Give me the flask again," said the Captain, ere five
minutes were flown; "the shades fall again; I will drive
them to hell! ha! they go&mdash;they go to the devil who
sent them; I shall live yet."</p>

<p>Again he drank the maddening liquid, which in a
fearful way buoyed up the sinking man; but the
alcohol and loss of blood combined worked on his
brain and fired it into a kind of frenzy. He sprang up
as if convulsed, and crouching amid the wolfskins that
covered him, like a wild beast in his lair, struck at an
imaginary foe which seemed to haunt him.</p>

<p>"Don't you see him, Bill? the fiend; have at him,
drive him away."</p>

<p>"I see nought," replied the old man, still watching
him with imperturbable countenance; "who is it you
see?"</p>

<p>"Who?" yelled the wretched man. "D'you ask who?
See him at the foot of my bed; 'tis the Devil himself."</p>

<p>"Come to overhaul his son," answered Bill, with a
brutal laugh. "What like is he, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Bill, you are the archfiend's self, to mock me in my
last distress. He is gone, thank God! No, no, there
he comes again&mdash;will no one scare the demon hence?
Ho! there are more&mdash;I see them&mdash;they crowd around
me&mdash;they gibber&mdash;they laugh a hellish laugh! All my
victims come to daunt me! There is Hesketh, Graham,
ye gods! Musgrave too; he points to the red hole in his
forehead. Avaunt, fiends, away! you frighten me not, I
dare you one and all. There's Strogonoff&mdash;ha! more,
by Jove&mdash;crowds&mdash;the hung, the tortured, the strangled,
the drowned&mdash;crowds of them, the infernal niggers!
the air is full of their horrid faces! they will tear
me. Save me, Bill. Oh, powers of darkness; <i>she</i> too,
she is there."</p>

<p>"Who is there?" said Bill; "you seem to have a good
company&mdash;a devil's dance, and women to dance too!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is she; then I did murder her. God above!
I dreamed I had failed, but no, she is there too."</p>

<p>"She, who is she?"</p>

<p>"Antonia, Juana, who you like. I may as well
make a clean breast of it&mdash;I poisoned her. I feel remorse
for her&mdash;for none of the rest. Ah! how pale she
is! how dull her once glorious eye!"</p>

<p>"Fiends of hell! you didn't; but you have said it,
dog, and for her you die." And with an expression
of horrid ire, the old man sprang from his couch and
gripped the dying man by his throat.</p>

<p>"Death, hell, and furies! would you murder me,
villain? a dying man. Ho, help! he is throttling me,
I cannot breathe&mdash;help&mdash;let go, dog!"</p>

<p>"No, I won't defraud death; you may die scatheless,
murderer, villain, foul poisoner! if there is a hell you
have dearly earned its torments."</p>

<p>"Leave me, hound, let me die in peace; but stay,
give me brandy once more, the room gets dark again,
scales of blackness seal my eyes. No, I will not drink;
I am better again, I shall yet live."</p>

<p>He lay back calm on his pillow, his eye looked bright,
he felt lighter, but it was only the dead man's lightening,
when the blood flows back to the seat of life
and relieves "the o'ertortured clay;" and what he
dreamed was the return of life was only the first touch
of death. It seemed the last mercy accorded to this
miserable man that at least he should die with full
possession of his senses.</p>

<p>"Bill," he said, "forgive me&mdash;forget that deed&mdash;I am
going now&mdash;it was that fiery liquor distorted my senses.
Bill, there is a hell, I feel its breath scorch me now!"</p>

<p>"Will you have the old priest to absolve you like?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I will die as I have lived; I will meet the
devil like a man; I have served him all my life; I have
sown the wind, why should I play him false now, or be
amazed if I reap the whirlwind? I have been a great
sinner, but God knows my blood is on your head, Bill;
you brought me to this, and&mdash;Oh God!&mdash;I am gone! A
mortal pang ran me through like a knife&mdash;the Devil has
hold of my heart! oh, heavens! I die&mdash;I d&mdash;i&mdash;e."</p>

<p>The death rattle in his throat choked the last words,
and the soulless form of what was once John de
Vere sank back,&mdash;the immortal soul fled to its dread
Maker.</p>

<p>"Ay, he is gone; wild and bad he was, yet he was a
fine fellow. I have had my revenge. The last act remains
only to be played out, but his murder must e'en be
avenged," said old Bill, as he lifted the dead man's hand
and let it fall nerveless again by his side. At that moment
Pedro and a youth of eleven or twelve, though he
looked much older, entered the chamber of death.</p>

<p>"How is Luigi? Where is our Captain?" asked
Pedro.</p>

<p>"Luigi is where we shall all be one day, with the
master he served!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Pedro, as he approached the bed on
which all that was once his chief lay. "Alas! my
brave Captain, my true friend, thou art laid low by a
felon hand! Thou wert a true brigand,&mdash;a bold, fearless
leader,&mdash;and what art thou now? inanimate clay&mdash;soulless
dust! Farewell, Luigi, foreigner though thou wert,&mdash;the
pride of the banditti, the terror of the Capitanata,
the scourge of the Abruzzi! Thou art lost now; dull
is the eagle eye&mdash;cold the impassioned cheek&mdash;nerveless
the strong arm&mdash;still the high heart. Woe to us now!
Who shall lead our bands? who shall think, plan, fight,
and divide the prey? Woe to the hand that spilt thy
blood! We have lost our head to-day; I have lost my
friend&mdash;my boonfellow! Alas! woe is me!"</p>

<p>Tears stood in the robber's eyes, to whom the late
Captain had been a guiding star and friend&mdash;even in
crime there is a sort of false glory&mdash;even among robbers
a sort of friendship!</p>

<p>The boy Giovanni, too, leaned over the death-bed.</p>

<p>"Alas! thou art low, high heart, brave soul! But,
like the rays of the setting sun, a twilight glory lingers
yet. Thy life is gone; not so thy example. The fiery
soul lingers still. I feel it swell within me! Our Captain
is gone. I will be leader now. I am young; but
it was his will. I am a boy in years&mdash;a man in soul.
This sword," taking the late Captain's blade, "shall
not lose its lustre. Call our men in; let them own
their chieftain."</p>

<p>Pedro blew a blast. Silently and sadly the whole
band assembled. They filled the room; there were at
least seventy bold spirits besides Bill, Giovanni, and
Pedro; there was only one of the other sex; she wept
bitterly, as she pressed the cold hand of Luigi.</p>

<p>"Comrades," said Bill, "our gallant Captain is dead!"
A groan of rage and sorrow arose from all. "He named
Giovanni as his successor. He is a stripling&mdash;a youth
in age; but he will make a worthy Captain. I will
train him up. Will you acknowledge him? Let those
who will hold up their swords."</p>

<p>An instant clash of steel took place; not a sword was
lacking.</p>

<p>"Then swear allegiance by your swords; and let the
spirit of the dead be witness!"</p>

<p>The oath was taken. A sullen silence reigned for an
instant.</p>

<p>"Leonora," said old Bill, "come here."</p>

<p>The maiden came. He whispered something in her
ear. She was about to depart when a noise was heard
in the bed where the dead lay. Every eye turned
towards the place. He had been now dead for half an
hour at least, and a shudder thrilled every soul as they
saw a faint movement take place on the lips of the
dead. Then two long, harrowing shrieks of agony rose
from the blue lips, and echoed with fearful tones through
the cavern! There was not a faint heart there, nor a
coward soul; yet when they heard that scream twice
repeated from the lips of the corpse, not a heart but
sunk, nor a cheek but paled! It was a cry as if a
hundred demons seized on the departed, and he yelled
as their fiendish grip encircled him!</p>

<p>Many of the bandits fled in dismay, and hurried in
confusion from the inner cave to drown their terror in
ardent spirits.</p>

<p>Old Bill alone approached the body, and pressed his
hand on the death-cold brow. It was icy. He had
been dead long ago!</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Pedro, "the incarnate fiend has
taken possession of the body. It were well to get
priestly aid, and exorcise him to depart."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Bill, in Italian, "the devil has got
into your own head. Tut! it was but the air a rushing
from his body. I've heard the like before."</p>

<p>"They were the most awful sounds I ever heard. I
shall never forget their terror," said Pedro, shaking his
head.</p>

<p>"Thou art a superstitious dog, and frightened by a
sound. What if the carcase itself arose? Could not
we fight it as well as a living man?"</p>

<p>"Old man, you believe in nothing, fear nothing!
You English are afraid of neither spirit nor demon. I
fear nothing mortal; but spirits from beyond the grave
I do fear; and I care not to say so!"</p>

<p>"You had better drink another kind of spirit to
drive such trash from your head," replied Bill, in
English, as Pedro had used that tongue, thus giving
force to the play on the word. "And, Pedro, see if
Leonora be gone; and get a coffin to stow away our
late Luigi in; and leave me here to lay out the corpse.
I'se warrant not one of you cowardly dogs would lay
claws on him now."</p>

<p>"Santa Maria! no! I am well pleased to be away."</p>

<p>Pedro, Giovanni, and the few remaining brigands
then left the old man and the corpse together, and
broached a cask of Falernian to drive away their terrors.
In silver goblets they drank their late Captain's health;
his quick delivery from purgatory; and vowed gold to
purchase his redemption; as well as swore to avenge
his death, if they got hold of the slayer; an important
"if," for Adrian Vardarelli was esteemed a cunning man,
who would not easily be taken.</p>

<p>The sun was setting on the Apennines, bathing them in
purple, as the postilion bearing the fatal news of the
tragedy of Val di Bovino neared the outskirts of Foggia.</p>

<p>Close to the road leading to Naples, the last of a row
of villas, was the residence of the Earl of Wentworth.
It was a small one compared to his villa at Naples;
but sufficiently large to excite the attention of the
traveller. Built on a gentle eminence, surrounded by
orange groves bearing their golden burden, its front
aspect faced the Apennines, embracing a fine view of
the rich country around, as well as the immense <i>tavoliere</i>
of Apulia, the pasturage of numerous herds of cattle
during the winter.</p>

<p>On the balcony looking down the high road sat the
Countess, now more matured in age than when we last
saw her. She was still extremely handsome, and, in
the opinion of many, her ripened beauty exceeded her
girlish charms. She was somewhat more inclined to
<i>embonpoint</i> than of old, but had worn remarkably well,
and still possessed the same luxuriant quantity of hair,
more richly brown than ever; the same winning, soft
blue eye; the same clear complexion. Her countenance
was saddened, but affliction had not soured; and when
she smiled her smile was sweet as ever. Time had
lightly laid his touch on her; she scarce looked five-and-twenty,
though she was half a dozen years older at
least.</p>

<p>A little distance from the Countess stood Lady
Augusta, who was then past eleven. She was tall for
her age, and built on a large scale; her eyes were her
mother's, but her hair was very much fairer; her well-formed
mouth betrayed the firmness of the De Veres.
She was too young for us to judge of her character, or
even what her appearance would yet be; but, if ever a
mother's prayers and loving example are sure of a
reward, doubtless Augusta would grow in beauty of
mind and person all the Countess wished.</p>

<p>"Augusta, love, is there no sign yet of our guests?
Look if you can see the carriage. They should have been
here long ago."</p>

<p>"No, mamma dear, I see nothing. We shall hear the
wheels first, for the orange-trees hide the turn in the
road."</p>

<p>"No sign of Lennox yet?" said the Marquis, entering
the verandah. "'Pon my word they are taking it easily."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I am beginning to feel nervous,&mdash;the roads
are so unsafe. I wish they had started earlier," said the
Countess.</p>

<p>"Pooh! you are always thinking of the brigands. I
tell you Lennox wrote to say he would take guards."</p>

<p>"I know; but that Luigi is such a dreadful man!
I quite dread going drives. And if he heard of my
jewels coming,&mdash;he gets news of everything. I do hope
nothing will happen."</p>

<p>"Never a fear. Young Lennox is a smart fellow.
They will come all right. They are armed, and the sbirri
with them. Luigi knows too well to risk an attack."</p>

<p>"I hear the clatter of a horse, mamma," said Augusta.
"Ah! see, here he comes. How he rides; and he is
stopping at our gate."</p>

<p>"Oh! I hope there is nothing wrong. Do go and
see, Arranmore. How my heart beats!"</p>

<p>Lord Arranmore, without waiting to be asked, had
left the balcony, and at the porch learned the dreadful
tidings from the postilion, who, almost dead with terror,
crossing himself and calling every saint to his aid, by
broken sentences told all, producing also the ensanguined
scarf.</p>

<p>The Marquis ordered the servants to give him refreshment
(but the poor man had little peace till he had
told them the whole twenty times over, and each time
a little more exaggerated than the last), and then returned
to break the news to the Countess.</p>

<p>"Your fears are, alas! too true," he said. "Our
friends have been attacked and fearfully murdered!"</p>

<p>"Merciful heavens!" exclaimed the Countess; "is
this true?"</p>

<p>"Too true. The wretched postilion, who alone survived,
told me all. Poor young Lennox attacked them
boldly, but was soon overpowered; then poor Lennox!
Faith! the tale is too shocking for your ears. Enough
to say, he was murdered, and the heads of father and
son stuck on poles! The worst part is, all your jewels
are gone too!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Arranmore! do not say so! I would gladly
have lost every trinket in the world to save one life.
But, Caroline, poor girl, what has become of her?" said
the Countess, whilst unfeigned tears of sorrow coursed
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Ah! poor girl! she was carried off by the ruffian
Adrian Vardarelli. Luigi is a bloodthirsty villain! but
Adrian a&mdash;I won't say my fears!"</p>

<p>"Oh! my poor Caroline! my heart bleeds for her
indeed! But had they not guards? How did it
happen?"</p>

<p>"They met a count at their last stage&mdash;no real count,
but a disguised brigand&mdash;who got everything out of our
poor murdered friend. Alas! he little knew to whom
he spoke. They hired two ruffians to guard them
instead of the sbirri! though heaven knows they would
not have helped them much! Then they were attacked&mdash;their
false guards turned on them, and the postilion
fled to hide in the woods, and from his hiding place saw
the whole! I cannot repeat the horrors he saw, or the
cold-blooded butchery! There was a quarrel between
the Vardarelli, it seems, for poor Caroline, and Adrian
mortally wounded Luigi. In the midst of the conflict
some twenty sbirri appeared. Adrian galloped off with
his prize. A fierce hand-to-hand fight took place,
which ended in the total annihilation of the sbirri, and
the victorious miscreants carried off their booty, and
dead and wounded, as well as the dying Luigi. It is a
comfort to think that vagabond has got his desert, and
the whole country will be rid of a nuisance."</p>

<p>"This is a most fearful tragedy. Alas! what a lawless
land this is, but perhaps the man may have exaggerated
the truth, and they may be only captive, God grant it."</p>

<p>"I fear it is too true; this stained scarf tells its tale.
Luigi never spared men; it was his plan to torture and
then stick the heads of his victims on poles. Adrian
only spares his captives for worse than death; poor Caroline,
a sad fate is hers. However, this has now come to
a pass, the whole country are up in arms, and they are
determined to find out their hiding place, a secret that
has baffled search as yet. I shall join, and so will Wentworth,
and we will be avenged on the rascals," said the
Marquis.</p>

<p>"Oh no, do not think of such a thing, dear Lord
Arranmore. Wentworth shall never go; if anything
happened to him it would kill me; for my sake leave
their punishment to the troops. Wentworth shall go
and see the King of Naples. Let us go and seek my
husband, he must be told of this awful event. Poor Mr.
Lennox and his son, and poor Caroline! I feel sick at
heart for her. How I shall treasure this sad relic,&mdash;and all
perhaps on my account! I would I had not asked them
to bring my jewels."</p>

<p>The Marquis, accompanied by the Countess and their
daughter, then descended to seek the Earl, who was busy
with state papers in his study. The Marquis knocked,
no answer came,&mdash;he opened the door, the Earl was not
there; his desk lay open on the table, his quill was
dipped in the ink, and a half written letter lay on the
floor.</p>

<p>"Curious he isn't here, and yet I only left him half an
hour ago; he must have gone out into the garden; see,
the windows are open: shall we go and see, Countess?"</p>

<p>"Yes, let us go. Augusta love, put your hat on, and
bring me a shawl, the dew is falling heavily."</p>

<p>In a few minutes they all three walked out through
the Venetian windows, which opened on a smooth lawn
bounded on all sides by orange trees, and explored the
gardens to see if the Earl was there, as it was a favourite
evening resort. After an hour, when it grew dark and
chilly, they gave up the search, and returned. He was
not in the house either; the servants were next questioned,
but had not seen their lord. Lady Wentworth
began to get anxious, and sent several servants to
various friends' houses near, as well as the reading-rooms,
and any other place where he might have gone to in
Foggia. After a long, anxious time they returned, but
without news.</p>

<p>"I am quite distressed," said the Countess, sinking
on a sofa. "I am so anxious. Where can he be? this
dreadful night has quite upset me. Where is my husband?"
and she burst into tears.</p>

<p>"Dear Lady Wentworth, you have no cause for any
anxiety; remember the Earl is continually away at night;
he often goes to tea somewhere you must know; we
have not sent to the right house."</p>

<p>"I know it is foolish of me, but I cannot help it, I am
so shaken by this awful night; oh, if anything has
happened to him, I shall die. Where is my Wentworth?
Why did he not tell me where he was going to?"</p>

<p>Lord Arranmore did all he could to pacify the lady,
but it was in vain he told her to fear nothing, as time
sped on, and no sign of her lord still. Augusta had
gone to her room, the Countess and he sat in the
drawing-room, or rather she sat sobbing with grief,
whilst he stood at the window straining his eyes to catch
any glimpse of his brother-in-law. The moon had
already risen round and full, showering down a light equal
to many a day in the north. Every now and then he
would say a word of comfort, begging her not to weep&mdash;"he
would soon come;" but as time still went on, and
not a sign of the absent one, he too began to feel a misgiving
in his heart, and his mind readily conjured up
real, or fancied terrors. The letter unfinished, the
windows open; he had evidently gone for a walk but
had not returned; could he have heard the fatal report,
and with his natural impetuosity at once ridden off to
the spot? as he thought of this a sigh unwittingly
escaped him as he fancied the perilous position his
friend was in. The quick ear of the Countess caught it,
and suddenly springing up she ran to him; taking
one of his strong hands between her own delicate fingers,
she looked up into his face with a despairing earnestness
that went to his heart, and with tears standing in her
large blue eyes, asked him why he sighed.</p>

<p>"Alas, Ellen," he fondly said, "I sighed to see you so
unhappy at nothing."</p>

<p>"My dear Arranmore, tell me the truth; do you not
now fear? hide nothing if you know it from me. Oh,
deceive me not, you too are anxious."</p>

<p>Often when we wish to comfort people we say the
worst things we can by a sort of heartless chance&mdash;contrariety.
The Marquis, anxious to alleviate her fears by
assigning a cause for her husband's absence, said the
very worst thing he could.</p>

<p>"I think it is not at all unlikely, Ellen, that Wentworth
has heard the news, and gone off with soldiers to
the spot."</p>

<p>"Gracious Heavens!" cried the Countess, "I never
thought of that; it is too true, that must be it, and he is
now in those dreadful ruffians' power,&mdash;he is perhaps,
wounded,&mdash;he may be&mdash;"</p>

<p>But her lips refused to frame the word, all she thought
to say was lost in a wild scream, as she sunk on the
floor, in a dead swoon. The Marquis, terrified at what
he had thoughtlessly done, rang the bell, while he lifted
the insensible lady, and placed her on a sofa. The fit
proved a long and dangerous one, and it was not till the
doctor had been sent for that Lord Arranmore felt free
from alarm. The medical gentleman said there was
no cause for any apprehension, and in a short time
she would recover. In the excitement occasioned by
the Countess's illness the absence of the Earl was
partially lost sight of, and whilst the Marquis was bending
over the patient, he was somewhat surprised by the
sudden reappearance of the Earl <i>in propri&acirc; person&acirc;</i>, who
when his lady's illness was told him, rushed to the
drawing-room, and forcing his way through the surrounding
servants, in an agony of fear pressed his wife's hand,
exclaiming:</p>

<p>"I knew it, see what my folly in not telling her has
done. I think everything is leagued to rob me of my
mind to-night,&mdash;mysterious guides, horrid butcheries,
robbers' dens, and now my wife dying."</p>

<p>The voice of her husband acted as a restorative when
the doctor was beginning to think all would fail, and the
Countess opened her eyes. When she saw the object of
her solicitude she burst into tears, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"God be thanked you are safe, my own Wentworth!
where have you been? why did you leave me?"</p>

<p>"My darling, I could not help it, I was unwillingly
lured away, but you shall hear all when you are better;
we must get you to bed at once, the horrors of this
evening have been too much for you."</p>

<p>The Countess grew rapidly better, and ere long was
calmly sleeping away her terrors, whilst the Earl drew
the Marquis aside and told him the cause of his absence.
For more than two hours they were closely closeted
together, and as they shook hands the Earl said:</p>

<p>"It has been truly the most wonderful day of my life."</p>

<p>"It indeed seems so,&mdash;it is the most extraordinary
history I ever heard in my life,&mdash;it out-Herods all
romances and novels. Faith, you were a bold fellow to
risk your life amongst such ruffians."</p>

<p>"Had I not I should never have known all this;
poor John, such an end,&mdash;and the other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After all, you would have been happier in blissful
ignorance, but you are sure it is not a tissue of lies?"</p>

<p>"Lies, oh, dear no, I have the proofs here," (producing
a large packet of papers,) "besides, I saw enough
to prove the truth of at least part; but we must not
talk any longer to-night; to-morrow we will sift the
whole to the bottom, and see what is to be done for our
unfortunate friends; their remains must be decently
interred if we can obtain them. I would we could trace
Caroline Lennox, and he who took her away. We shall
have enough to do, first here and then in England, for
thither I must go; we shall have work for the Crown
lawyers."</p>

<p>"I' faith I hardly like to go home through that horrid
valley; what if they cut us up too?"</p>

<p>"No fears, I have a pass for all Italy; no brigand
would harm us were he to see this paper."</p>

<p>The Earl produced a small paper, on which were
inscribed some hieroglyphical marks, on which the
Marquis looked with some interest.</p>

<p>"This is a queer country after all," he said, "but we
are got to talking again. Good night, I shall be glad to
sleep off my thoughts."</p>

<p>"And I too," said the Earl; "but sleep will not chase
mine away. Good night, I must see how Ellen is."</p>

<p>With these words they parted and sought their
different rooms. The Earl found his wife calmly sleeping,
and kissing her white forehead, prepared to follow
her example. Whilst the whole house are bathed in
forgetfulness we shall trespass on our readers' time a
little longer, and account for the Earl's mysterious
absence for so many hours. But as it is a long story we
must leave it for the few next chapters, and we hope
they will be sufficiently interesting to reward the reader's
careful perusal of their strange contents.</p>

<p>The Earl had been engaged, as we have before stated,
on some business connected with the Government that
was then in power and the Neapolitan interests; so
busily was he engaged in his occupation that his mind
was thoroughly abstracted from everything else, and he
neither saw nor heard anything that was going on around
him. His study was immediately beneath the verandah
on which the Countess and his daughter were then
sitting. The balcony formed a sort of roof over a
tessellated pavement that led to the lawn; up the pillars
and trellised work that supported this verandah were
twined vines and other creepers: these pillars, with their
festoons, extended the whole length of the villa, and
opened into a dark avenue of poplar trees. The
windows of his room led to this walk, and being in
Italian form, opened like a glass door, thus serving the
part of window and door at once. They were open at
the time we speak of, and the west wind blew lightly
into the chamber, bearing on its wings the aromatic
perfume of the orange groves. We have purposely been
minute in this description, and why the reader will
judge best by-and-by. The escritoire, where the Earl
pursued his avocation, was placed about a couple of
yards from the open window, and he sat with his back
to the western hills glowing in the departing beams of
the setting sun; perhaps he chose this position lest the
beauties of nature should call him from his duties, and
tempt him to neglect his important studies. Several
law books in English and Italian lay round him, and
these he from time to time consulted, as he wrote.
Once he thought a shadow, as of a person crossing between
him and the sun, passed over the sheet he inscribed&mdash;it
was perhaps the Countess, or Augusta, so he
thought, and without even turning round he again
wrote rapidly.</p>

<p>Had there been a third person in the room (for there
were two there) he would have seen this intruder
noiselessly enter by the inviting window; fearful of disturbing
the writer, the figure crept on past him, till it
stood exactly opposite, treading as if on velvet, so lightly
fell each footstep. The intruder, an Italian maiden
thirteen years of age&mdash;though the precocity of her
climate gave her the appearance of a girl of sixteen at
least&mdash;was dressed in the picturesque costume of the
mountains. She had almost attained her full height,
which was above the average, and revelled in all the
freshness of a beauty, which, if it might prove short-lived,
was radiant as the flower which fades first, owing
to its surpassing bloom. The hot sun of her native
hills had wooed, but not marred, the soft cheek; all its
warmth seemed brightly received into it, as in a mirror!
large lustrous eyes, gloriously black, fringed by long
lashes, full lips of carmine hue, and a nose so slightly
arched as to seem almost, but not altogether Grecian,
completed this damsel's charms. Her dress was well
calculated to set off without detracting from a face which
needed no foil, and a form which required no art to
enhance. Her long hair, dark as night, was braided
in broad plaits which fell down her back through the
folds of a scarlet silk kerchief, that confined her tresses
and contrasted well with their raven hue, throwing a
warmth of colour over all. A tight boddice of black
silk velvet, laced with gold braid, developed the bold
outlines of her gently heaving breast. A dark-blue
skirt descended nearly to her sandals&mdash;but not low
enough to hide her well-shaped ankles; a narrow apron
of various bright colours in thin stripes, fringed with
gold lace at the hem, completed her costume. She
wore a few ornaments all of costly workmanship, pendants
of gold dropped from her tiny ears, a chain of
pearls encircled her neck; from the end of this string
hung a black cross set with diamonds of great value,
and on her fingers sparkled several rings. Folding her
arms across her bosom she watched the Earl, so occupied
in his labours he knew not who watched him. The
expression of the young girl's face was peculiar, and
to have seen how earnestly and lovingly she fixed her
gaze on the Earl, a stranger would have thought she
knew him and loved him (and yet though she knew
him she had never before been in his house), or would
have imagined she was more to him than she seemed&mdash;in
this surmise he would perhaps be nearer the
mark.</p>

<p>Lord Wentworth was a true lover of nature, besides
possessing a considerable amount of scientific knowledge.
Botany was one of his favourite pursuits, and
often he was accustomed to take long rides amongst
the hills to pursue his attractive study. Whenever he
had bent his course to the Val di Bovino he had been
met by a young Italian girl, who, for some unaccountable
reason, seemed to have the greatest affection for
him. Whenever she heard the sound of his horse's feet,
as if by instinct she was at his side, and with the sweet
manners of southern countries used to proffer a bouquet
of the most rare and beautiful wild flowers. He used
to talk to her, and often she was his guide to secluded
grots, or dark dells where modest flowers sprung.
There was something so innocent in this affection, so
charming in the young creature who gave it, that she
quite won his heart, and far oftener than he would
otherwise have done he bent his horse's course to the
Val, and experienced a sort of delight in the company
of this child of the South. It was not love&mdash;it was a
nameless, but pure affection&mdash;more of the affection of a
father to his child. He had never once missed his little
mountain maiden. Unable to devise wherefore she had
so set her fancy on him, he nevertheless felt all the
pleasurable sensations of the feelings he inspired. There
was another reason why he felt a peculiar interest in
her,&mdash;this was the wonderful resemblance she bore to one
with whom he had once played so sad a part; she was
the image of Juana Ferraras, as he had known her
many years since. So struck was he with this similitude
that he had used every endeavour to try and
induce the little girl to come and visit him, in order
that the Countess might see her&mdash;but all his endeavours
had proved vain; and though he had prevailed on the
Countess several times to accompany him to the Val
in order to show her his little Leonora&mdash;such was the
name he knew her by&mdash;yet either by a provoking mischance,
or well-laid scheme, she was never to be seen
excepting when he was quite alone; and the Countess
used to twit him about her, declaring she must either be
a fairy, or an Egeria of his brain. He had given her
some rings, and other slight souvenirs, but she seemed
above any pecuniary help&mdash;so he had never offered her
money; he had vainly striven to find out who she was,
and where she lived; after a period of three months'
almost daily communication with his mysterious and
romantic acquaintance, he had yet failed in every
inquiry, and he began almost to fancy she was some
being unearthly, and perchance a lingering <i>dryad</i> of old,
who still haunted her woodland dell! We have made
this digression, as without it the meeting of the Earl and
this maiden, for it was she who stood before him, would
seem unaccountable at the least. A breath more deeply
drawn than her usual respirations attracted at last the
attention of the Earl to his visitor. He gazed up from
his letter, and was not a little astonished when he saw
his friend there.</p>

<p>"Leonora, my little Egeria&mdash;you here? And how
did you come, and what brings you here?"</p>

<p>"My Lord, I have been here some time; you were so
engrossed you did not see nor hear me enter. I hope
I do not intrude."</p>

<p>"Oh! no&mdash;such an intrusion does not deserve the
name: and what does my Egeria want? Is she come at
last to see my lady, and little girl?"</p>

<p>"No, I am come on an important errand&mdash;I am a
messenger with strange tidings."</p>

<p>"Of good I am sure, such a pretty herald could not
bear ill tidings."</p>

<p>"Do not be too confident, my Lord; the bright sunset
heralds in black night."</p>

<p>"Well, my love, you must tell me, and if I can do
anything for you my help shall not be lacking."</p>

<p>"It is not here, my Lord, I can tell you; it is not me
they concern, but yourself,&mdash;will you follow me?"</p>

<p>"Follow you&mdash;and whither? Really this is quite romantic
and the hour well chosen! And what can concern
me? Well, I will come if it is not far."</p>

<p>"It is far though; as far as the Val di Bovino."</p>

<p>"On my word, that is a long distance; and it is now
getting late,&mdash;will not to-morrow do as well?"</p>

<p>"No, Signore,&mdash;to-night; it is of the utmost importance;
you know not what hangs on your coming."</p>

<p>"But, my love, the Val is not a 'canny place,' as we
say in Scotland; it is full of robbers. Now, I fear not
for myself, but my life is of value to my family; it would
not be safe nor right for me to go."</p>

<p>"You need not fear, Signore; no one will touch you.
I have a free pass from Luigi; see here it is (showing a
card with some masonic words written on it); you need
have no fear with me."</p>

<p>"That alters it certainly. But let me at least tell my
wife I am going."</p>

<p>"My Lord, time is precious; lose no more; every
minute is of priceless value. Waste no more time,
Signore!"</p>

<p>Certainly, thought the Earl, this is a curious predicament,
and still there is something so romantic in it; I
cannot help going,&mdash;and yet I may be doing wrong.
But Leonora would not betray me; I am sure of her,
safe as steel! But she may be the artless messenger of
Luigi, and my life may be in peril. I do not value it
at a straw for myself; but Ellen,&mdash;no, I ought not to go.</p>

<p>"Leonora, I am not justified in going with you. To-morrow
I will meet you at the Val."</p>

<p>A shade of sorrow passed over the young girl's face.
"Alas! Signore; then you trust me not; you think I
would lead you to peril. Farewell, Signore. I had
thought differently of you; I am sadly mistaken. You
have no confidence; farewell! You will never see your
Leonora more, but you may repent your not following
her!"</p>

<p>As she said these words, she mournfully turned away.
It was not in mortal to resist any more.</p>

<p>"I wrong you, love, I do!" exclaimed the Earl. "Stay,
I will come. I will follow you anywhere. There could
not be treachery in such a brow!"</p>

<p>"Ah, you are like yourself again! The fearless, the
confiding," said the girl, taking his hand and pressing
her lips to it; "you will see you have nought to fear,
for every hair of your head is dear to me as my life.
But, Signore, make haste; we have kept away too long;&mdash;this
way; no one must see us;&mdash;beneath the verandah,
down the poplar avenue, and then away, away!" and
the girl clapped her hands with delight.</p>

<p>"But stay, child,&mdash;my horse; I must get that; I am
not going to walk!"</p>

<p>"Nor need you; but I have got a horse for you all
ready; follow me&mdash;<i>presto prestissimo!</i>"</p>

<p>The Earl had just time to fling a cloak over his
shoulders, and snatch up a hunting cap, ere she was out
of sight. He then followed her quickly,&mdash;under the portico,
down the avenue, and then through a small postern,&mdash;and
he was outside his gardens, and the Apennines in
front. Still his fair guide moved on; she seemed to float
rather than walk over the ground, towards a dark myrtle
grove. By this time the sunlight had quite forsaken
the west; the hills had re-assumed their dusky hue,
and the full moon rising in the east began to shed a
cold lustre on the dew-bathed landscape. Still in the
full vigour of manhood, strong, bounding in health, and
with a mind ready for adventure, the Earl saw something
delightful in the mystery of his errand; the loveliness
of his guide, the hour, the place, the uncertain
light of the moon, the originality of the whole&mdash;all was
charming! But yet here was he, a peer of England, a
husband of a fond wife, a father of a loving child, racing
at night after a stranger almost, a pretty Italian girl, to
a well-known haunt of robbers, to hear some wonderful
story, or see some wonderful thing. It was ludicrous as
well as romantic. He almost began to laugh at himself
as he thought what the Marquis would think of him,
and to be angry with himself when he thought what
anxiety his freak would give Ellen. He had nearly forty
miles to ride there and back, and supposing they did
this in four hours' hard riding, allowing a couple of
hours for delay and the time taken in revealing the
secret, this would not bring him home till eleven at
night, and during those six hours his wife would be
wretched. But it was too late for regrets now; he was
pledged to follow his guide. After all, he thought, I
have often been later; she will but think I have gone to
a friend's house, or the library.</p>

<p>Excusing himself thus, he followed Leonora still into the
myrtle wood. She at last stopped, and, taking a little ivory
whistle from her bosom, blew a signal. In less than two
minutes a suspicious-looking man, leading two horses, appeared.<a name="FNanchor_E_" id="FNanchor_E_"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_" title="The costumes of Leonora and this bandit are true to life." class="fnanchor">[E]</a>
He was dark and swarthy in appearance, with
long hair and beard untrimmed, as well as fierce moustache;
wore a pointed hat gaily decked with ribbons, a
jacket of crimson velvet embroidered with gold, breeches
of dark blue velvet slashed with crimson, buskins of
leather, and long spurs on his heels; his bronzed complexion
and fierce look argued him a dangerous fellow,
perhaps a bandit; but a silken sash round his middle,
stuck full of pistols, knives, and stilettos, and a musket
slung on his back, proclaimed it too certainly. When the
Earl saw this fellow, he began to think he had been over-ready
to follow a stranger; however, Leonora looked incapable
of treachery, and he still trusted her. He made
friends with the man by slipping a gold piece into his hand
as he took the bridle of his horse. The bandit grinned
as he saw it glitter on his palm, showing a white and
regular set of teeth. The Earl then lifted his fair guide
into her <i>selle</i>, which was covered with velvet richly embroidered
with gold, gave the silken reins into her hand,
and then prepared to mount his own steed. The horse
he was to ride was a large and powerful Arab, coal black
excepting a star of white on its forehead. The saddle
and reins were of the finest leather, stamped with
elegant designs. His guide's was a pretty jennet of the
Andalusian breed, snow-white, with flowing mane and
tail. She managed the skittish little animal with great
address, and as the Earl followed slowly on his own noble
charger, he thought he had never seen a prettier pair
than guided him,&mdash;a more perfect horsewoman than his
guide, a better bred animal than she rode on. The
young girl gently walked her steed till beyond the confines
of the wood, when she put out its powers more
freely along a bye-path. It was not long ere they
reached the main road, and then, waving her hand, she
set off at a breathless speed and soon reached the grassy
plains of the open country. The Earl, an experienced horseman,
easily kept up with his guide, and he thought he had
seldom pressed a nobler horse than the one that bore him.</p>

<p>When they reached the plain, leaving the road, she
dashed forward across the sandy ground; the Earl
followed. Their horses drove the numerous herds of
cattle that fed on the immense pasturage right and
left before them. Lord Wentworth was in high spirits
then, and enjoyed the gallop over the great common as
every rider must, especially by moonlight. Then there
was the romance of the ride, following a beautiful girl
to an unknown place, and as his courser's hoofs spurned
the sandy soil, he almost shouted the "Tallyho!" of old
England in his glee. It was not long ere they reached
the hills, that advanced like great barriers; it seemed as
if they were inaccessible and not to be pierced; but as
they drew nearer the Earl saw the gap of a river through
the mountains, and dense woods of acacia, arbor vit&aelig;, and
nut-trees became visible, as well as the road they had left.</p>

<p>Entering again on the resumed route, Leonora drew
the reins to breathe her panting horse; he followed
her example, and side by side they began to walk their
horses up the road, gradually becoming steeper as it
crossed the chain of hills. The moon was now getting
high in the heavens, and shone with silver rays on the
brown mountains and woods above and below them. It
was dead silence all, save the flow of the river beneath
chafing against its rocky sides, or the shrill cry of the
<i>cicalas</i>, the rustle of the dried leaves stirred by the
passing wind, the tramp of the iron hoof, or the snort of
the fiery animals they scarce compelled into a reluctant
walk. Neither spoke a word; he was too busy with his
own thoughts, the girl too modest to begin a conversation.
Slowly they paced upwards; the woods grew denser
on either side; the mountains rose darker; the roar of
the waters grew louder; but in silence they still rode on.</p>

<p>They had now reached the middle of the pass, and
arrived at the scene of the morning's tragedy, of
which the Earl as yet knew nothing. The first thing
that caught his eye, was the carriage, which stood in
lonely desertion in the middle of the road; some fifty
paces ahead a little beyond it his eye caught a glimpse of
two poles, one on either side of the road, bearing aloft
their dread tokens of guilt and murder. The moon shone
on the haggard features, and rendered them disgusting
and horrid. He shuddered as he saw them; on the
road too he perceived numbers of bodies stretched in
various groups. It was like a field of battle. As they
approached, two or three dark animals rushed away into
the woods,&mdash;they were wolves come down on their prey.</p>

<p>"What in God's name has occurred here?" said the
Earl, as he now passed directly beneath the poles, and
with difficulty guided his horse amongst the numerous
corpses.</p>

<p>"Some poor travellers whom the Vardarelli robbed
and murdered to-day," answered the girl, with a <i>sang
froid</i> that seemed totally unlike her.</p>

<p>"My God!" exclaimed the Earl, "it is even so; these
are my unhappy guests! It is Mr. Lennox and his
wretched son&mdash;I know those ghastly heads! Leonora,
I can go no further; those death-pale faces will long
haunt me!"</p>

<p>"What, Signore, are you come so far, and afraid to go
on? True, this is a sad sight&mdash;the marks of plunder,
rapine, and murder,&mdash;but with me you need not fear."</p>

<p>"You understand me not: these are my friends&mdash;they
have been cruelly butchered."</p>

<p>"I am sorry they were Signore's friends; but by following
me you may gain much&mdash;even by finding out
about them."</p>

<p>"Wretched girl!" exclaimed Lord Wentworth; "is
it possible you belong to this fierce gang?&mdash;so young, so
innocent-looking! Ha!" he continued, looking on
her with changed expression, "I see it now. I have
been decoyed&mdash;duped!&mdash;fool that I was to come alone,
and unarmed. I shall be set on, and murdered, and my
head stuck by those! I will at least give them a chase
for it," and he turned his horse's head.</p>

<p>"Hear me," cried the girl, "you wrong me, Signore&mdash;you
wrong me! I have not deserved this! Follow me
still&mdash;judge not by appearances, they may be against
me: you will live to prove my truth; only have faith in
one who would not for worlds injure you."</p>

<p>"By my soul, you take me for a fool! No, no, fair
maiden, prevention is better than cure&mdash;you shan't get
my head without a run for it."</p>

<p>"Once more, listen, my Lord. To return alone, even
on that fleet horse, is certain death;&mdash;these woods are
full of those who never missed their aim; and to go on
with me is your only chance; and I vow by the great
God&mdash;by the blessed Virgin&mdash;not a hair of your head
shall be injured! Do you believe me?&mdash;look at my
face and see if truth is not written there. Oh! for your
own&mdash;my sake&mdash;follow on. I am not what I appear!"</p>

<p>The Earl looked at her; the moon shone full on her
face&mdash;it was the face of a Madonna&mdash;no shade of falsehood
there.</p>

<p>"I will follow&mdash;I will trust you; only remember,
Signorina, if you deceive me you break your word, your
oath, your honour,&mdash;lead on."</p>

<p>The mysterious guide<a name="FNanchor_F_" id="FNanchor_F_"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_" title="See Note M. The Mysterious Guide." class="fnanchor">[F]</a> then reining her horse to the
left, descended through the woods towards the river. He
followed. The descent was difficult, and very steep;
the moonlight hardly pierced the trees above.</p>

<p>"This girl," he thought, "is either the strangest and
most faithful I ever met, or the worst arch-deceiver I
ever was duped by."</p>

<p>After a toilsome descent, in which their horses often
stumbled, they approached the river with its limestone
cliffs, and emerged on an open green. Here Leonora
dismounted, and motioned to the Earl to do the same.
She again blew the ivory whistle, a similarly-costumed
bandit appeared, received the horses, and decamped as
mysteriously as he came.</p>

<p>"Signore," said the girl, "you have promised to trust
me; will you submit to be blindfolded, for you must no
longer see the path you go?"</p>

<p>"Upon my soul, you are determined to give me cause
to place my confidence in you: I suppose you will ask
me next if I have any objection to be thrown in yonder
river? However, have your way, I submit myself entirely
to your honour."</p>

<p>Untying a gay scarf that bound her waist, she bandaged
the Earl's eyes; then taking his hand led him
forward.</p>

<p>The path down which she led him was rough,
stony, and seemed extremely steep. By-and-by he was
aware he was crossing a bridge, and heard the river
swirl and roar beneath him; it seemed far below, as
near as he could judge by his ear. His route then lay
upward, and ere long he was aware he had bade adieu
to the moonlight and open air. An involuntary shudder
ran through him as he perceived he must now be in a
cave, from the hollow sound, and the echoes of his clanking
strides. His guide felt the thrill, at least he fancied
she must have perceived it, from her almost immediately
afterwards bidding him not to fear. For more than a
hundred yards, as he judged, she led him on through
this vault; then he began to distinguish sounds, which
soon resolved themselves into voices and laughter: they
grew more and more distinct, till he could almost catch
the individual words; then a sudden turn in the passage
seemed to lead him away from them, and they grew
more and more distant, till he lost the power of catching
them any more.</p>

<p>He heard a footstep next, approaching, nearer and
nearer, till it seemed beside him. His guide stopped, and
spoke to the man in a language he did not understand.
A gruff voice answered her. Another shudder ran through
him as he thought he must now be in a den of robbers,
and his life depended on the frail thread of a woman's
word. Still he did not fear for himself; and he was
determined that if, after all, he had been duped, he would
try and sell his life dearly.</p>

<p>The thought of Ellen, too, oppressed him, and he bitterly
cursed his folly in trusting himself to such chances.
Another turn in the passage, and suddenly, a red glare
told him he was again in light. There was something
at least reinspiriting in being in light;&mdash;the thought of
an assassin's dagger in the dark is horrible!</p>

<p>Almost immediately after, he felt his guide's fingers
untying the scarf that bound his eyes. She slowly unknotted
it, and then, as she left her hold, it dropped
on the ground.</p>

<p>The lights dazzled his eyes, long accustomed to the
dark, so much, that for an instant he could see nothing.
When he recovered his sight, the first thing he looked
for was his guide. She was gone!&mdash;the scarf lay at his
feet, but she was gone! Had she been only a wraith to
lead him so far, and then forsake him?</p>

<p>When the Earl found himself thus mysteriously deserted,
his next desire was to find out by what secret
passage his guide had departed. He turned round, and
saw a narrow passage cut out of the naked rock, which
seemed the only outlet from the cavern he was left in;
a black curtain, made of skins of animals, hung from the
ceiling across this doorway. Having discovered the road
by which his guide had conveyed herself away, he then
thought of following her; but on second thoughts resolved
to await the issue, as he might otherwise come on
some very unpleasant sort of fellows. So he began to
look about him.</p>

<p>The scene in which his eyes were again opened
was sufficiently strange, and kept up the romantic
incidents of the evening. He was the sole inmate of
a cavern, formed by nature, but enlarged by art; it
might be eighteen feet in length by ten in breadth; the
roof, which was cut into an arched shape, was not more
than eight, or at the most eight and a half feet above the
ground; the walls were roughly squared out of the limestone
rock, and were hung, like the sides of an armoury,
with all kinds of offensive and defensive weapons,&mdash;muskets,
sabres, rapiers, pikes, spears, pistols, cutlasses,
knives, and stilettos of all sizes and shapes! A ledge of
rock ran half way round the cavern, about two feet from
the ground, which was strewed with rushes; this served
as a bench, and was not an uncomfortable one, if we
might judge from the numerous wolf skins that covered
it. At the extreme end of the room, if we may so call it,
was a low bed,&mdash;the same on which Luigi had, a few
hours since, yielded his soul to Him who gave it.</p>

<p>There was another object, however, which chiefly attracted
the Earl's attention; on a low table which stood
about the centre of the chamber, or dungeon, or cavern,
whichever the reader pleases to dignify it by, stood a most
solemn piece of furniture in the shape of a coffin; its ornaments,
if it had any, were hidden by a pall of black velvet,
with a fringe of silver lace-work, showing great taste in design,
which, streaming downwards till it swept the ground,
completely shut out any view of the coffin itself, or its
occupant, if it had one. At the head, the foot, and the
two shoulders were placed four handsome silver candelabra
with wax tapers lighted, to a fanciful eye denoting
the figure of a cross; this design was further borne out
by two swords, which were placed crosswise, but St.
Andrew's cross, and not the Cross was shadowed by them.</p>

<p>There is always something solemn, even to a healthy
and strong person, in the narrow bed in which at last
all must lie down! it seems to remind the living they
too must die; it is an object on which few can gaze
without feeling a sense of dread! In our hero's situation
there was much to increase these sensations, which
he would have doubtless had at any time, but which at
the present moment came with unusual force on his mind.
He stood alone, amid a den of thieves and murderers, to
which he had been wiled by a mysterious guide. Why
was he there? For what reason had he been brought
hither? He looked on that grim reminder of mortality
with awe! He thought of the tyrant of Rome,&mdash;how
Domitian had introduced his guests to a dark room,
where they saw their coffins, and where black men armed
rushed in to terrify them! Had he been thus brought,&mdash;was
that narrow box to be his last resting-place? He
felt a sickening feeling of horror creep over him. He
was a brave man, and had it been in open day would
have made a stand against any number; but to be immured
in such a place,&mdash;so secret no mortal else could
penetrate to him, or assist him; to be brutally butchered,
perhaps cruelly tortured first; to die alone; his fate to
be hid for ever; his body to moulder in these vaults; all
was awful!&mdash;no wonder he felt terror! He thought too
of his home, of his fond wife, his only child, and all his
friends,&mdash;they would never know how or where he had
died! Even now perhaps Ellen was seeking him with tears!
alas! she would never find his lurking-place,&mdash;she would
have no thread to pierce the labyrinth! Oh! the hours,&mdash;perhaps
years of despairing hope,&mdash;years would give
no clue! How he cursed the hour he listened to that
tale! How he despised himself for his credulity! a kind
of giddy feeling came over his brain; a dizzy haze rose
before his eyes. The coffin and its black pall, and dim
lights were there, but they grew dim, and still dimmer!
Was it a dream after all? He pressed his hand over
his eyes; he withdrew it again;&mdash;no, it was real, horribly
true! Again that sickening, sinking feeling crushed
him! He looked for a seat; there was the wolf skin
covered ledge: he walked towards it, and then sank
away. He soon felt better; the giddiness passed away,
and he began once more to soliloquise.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, almost aloud, "there is no doubt of it:
Luigi has lured me hither by means of my interest in this
pretty Italian,&mdash;for what I dare not think! I have been
properly cozened,&mdash;nicely hoodwinked! On my soul, I
seem to deserve my fate as a punishment for my folly!
What have I done?&mdash;left a fond wife, an only child,
friends, home, everything,&mdash;all to follow a handsome girl,
across a country where robbers are as plentiful as hazel
nuts! A wild, hair-brained fool I have been, and am
likely to pay the piper for it too! A pretty mess to get
into!&mdash;left alone in a den of murderers, in the power of
the fierce Luigi,&mdash;a man without even the mercy of wild
wolves, for they kill at once, whilst he leaves me in sickening
suspense. I would I knew the worst at once,&mdash;anything
is better than uncertainty. But then Leonora!
could she be so false,&mdash;surely all her love for me was not
a cheat? I can scarcely think so. Who is she? Perhaps
Luigi's daughter. Ha! I have it now: and she
is perhaps laughing at my credulity! What is her word
to a heretic? She can get absolved from her vow by
the next priest! It is a comfortable creed the Roman
Catholic: a nice one for robbers, murderers, and cheats.
I wonder all wicked men are not Catholics! But why
am I here? They will get little from me,&mdash;my watch
and half a dozen pieces of gold; surely for this I have
not been brought here? If they wanted my blood they
could have had it a dozen times; the man I met when
blindfolded,&mdash;a stab in the back would have done the
business,&mdash;a push off the bridge by my fair guide! After
all, matters are not so bad; there may be something behind
all this seeming mystery. Leonora may be my
friend; I surely wrong her; vice could never assume such
a winning guise; falsehood never lurked beneath an open
brow like hers! I will 'bide my sugh,' as we say over
the Tweed; I may live to laugh over all this yet,&mdash;although
that coffin is no laughing matter, God knows!
I would I had anything else in the room,&mdash;it scares one
out of his usual coolness! I hope there is not a corpse
inside! Old Andrew would say, 'it's no canny.' I
declare I will go and have a peep under the cloth,&mdash;perhaps
there is a friend in it, after all, and I am left to read
the riddle; he will think me a slow guesser."</p>

<p>The change of thoughts had so altered his feelings he
leaped up quite like himself again, and was about to put
his plan into execution, when he heard loud voices and
oaths, in Italian, English, and other tongues, alarmingly
near.</p>

<p>"Ho!" he said, almost aloud, "after all, first thoughts
are true, and Luigi's ruffians come to give me cause to
know them; but, by heaven! we will have a fight,&mdash;they
shall not kill me like a fox run to earth! there are
stores of weapons here; I'll sell my life dearly; some of
them shall know 'it is ill fashing wi' a desperate man,'
as my northern friends say; they'll find what it is to
beard a lion at bay!"</p>

<p>Whilst he was uttering all this between his clenched
teeth, he caught a sword off the wall, and two pistols;
the latter he cocked,&mdash;they were ready loaded; he looked
at the flints&mdash;for percussion had not got to Italy yet&mdash;they
were dry, so was the priming; holding one in each
hand, he placed the sword across the coffin in easy reach,
and stood prepared for any odds. His bold spirits rose
with the danger; the blood mounted to his cheeks; his
eye brightened; he felt his heart beat full,&mdash;not with
fear, but eager excitement,&mdash;the high resolve to die like
a hero! It was a perfect picture! With one foot advanced,
he stood ready, a pistol in either hand, with their
tubes pointed to the ground, the sword within reach, unsheathed.
He waited in this attitude nearly two minutes,&mdash;the
voices had ceased, all was silent.</p>

<p>"He seems determined to try my patience," he
thought; "he will have the warmer reception; for, now
I think of it, I will have a knife for close work; they at
least give one weapons enough for defence."</p>

<p>He stretched to secure a stiletto off the wall, still
keeping his gaze on the doorway; he reached one down,
and placed it on the pall beside the sword; but in taking
it from the nail on which it hung, he accidentally pulled
down a couple of cutlasses immediately above; they fell
with a loud clanging on the rocky flooring. At the
same moment he heard a footstep approaching,&mdash;the
heavy tramp rang through the arched passage.</p>

<p>"Now for it," he said; "shall I shoot the villain directly
he enters, or hear what the scoundrel has to say?
The last is best; it is but a single fellow, and, at the
worst, I will show him two can play at this game."</p>

<p>The step came nearer, and sounded louder and louder.
The Earl waited in breathless expectation; the curtain
moved,&mdash;it was pushed aside, and a figure entered. A
look of surprise passed over the Earl's face: he had expected
to see a fine, showily-dressed brigand,&mdash;probably
Luigi Vardarelli himself; instead of that, he saw in the
figure before him an old weather-beaten tar, not in the
picturesque garb of the banditti, but in a fisherman's
costume. The man had a hangdog look; his features
were coarse and repulsive; a ghastly scar seamed his
brow; his lank hair was grizzled and matted; his beard
and whiskers tangled more grizzly still, and besprinkled
with snuff; he wore a rough pilot jacket, and heavy
fisherman's boots, which reached up to his hips; his
figure short, but broad as a bear; his expression at once
gloomy and fierce. His grotesque dress, in such a den,&mdash;a
man so wholly unexpected, so out of place&mdash;was so
ridiculous, that the Earl could resist no longer, and
throwing his pistols down right and left, regardless of
the danger of their exploding, he burst into a merry fit of
laughter.</p>

<p>The old man,&mdash;none other than Bill Stacy, as the
reader must have guessed,&mdash;regarded this outburst of
jocularity with savage scorn; and when the Earl seemed
to have regained his composure,</p>

<p>"The deevil take your daffin and laughin'!" said old
Bill, who had not forgotten all his Scotch, "is this a
place for your whiggery, think you, and the dead sae
near? And what, in the fiend's name, have you loaded
yourself with slashers, barkers, and whingers?&mdash;what the
deevil have you to fear,&mdash;can't you trust old Bill?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, my good man, I was expecting such
a totally different guest, your appearance quite upset
me! To your questions,&mdash;my being here is the best
answer to them, and proves I fear you not. Trust you
I did not; and being unarmed, and not knowing but
that a dozen ruffians would be on me, I armed myself.
It seems I had no need, and what I thought would be a
tragedy, turns out a comedy. Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>"Stow your ill-timed jesting, or I'll soon teach you,
my Lord, where ye be, and all your arms will avail ye
but little!"</p>

<p>The brutal manners of this old man proved to the
Earl he was not yet out of danger, and he said, "I believe,
old man, you are William Stacy. I have heard of
you before. I have come many miles, and am in a hurry
to be off again, so speed me my errand and let me be gone.
I assure you this cave is not the lodging I desire for the
night."</p>

<p>"Hark ye," cried Bill, with a terrific oath, "how do
you know you will ever leave it? what if it were your
lodging for aye? we are alone, what would hinder me
from knocking you on the head?"</p>

<p>"If my death is your object, you had better go and
call your fellow murderers. I fear you not, old man; I can
hold my own against you&mdash;come on&mdash;I dare you&mdash;one
at a time&mdash;fair play!" said the Earl, reaching the sword
with his hand, and taking it off the coffin.</p>

<p>Old Bill looked at him with surprise not unmingled
with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Put it down, you need not fear, I was but jesting.
Had I wanted your blood, young man, what had hindered
me frae taking it this three times?&mdash;sit ye down, I have
that to tell you will make you open your glimmers."</p>

<p>"I fear not," said the Earl; "delay me however no
longer; my wife will be anxious for my return."</p>

<p>"She maun e'en wait," said Bill.</p>

<p>He sat down, relieved at least from his worst apprehensions.</p>

<p>"And now," said the old man, still standing, "d'you
ken where ye have got to?"</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the Earl, "I thought it was to Luigi's
cave, but your appearance forbids me to think so now."</p>

<p>"Luigi," said Bill, "ay, ay,&mdash;his den, and so it is&mdash;but
sma' harm could he do now, though folk knew what
he could do this forenoon!"</p>

<p>"Then you are implicated in the dreadful murder of
my friends. I passed the place and saw the horrid
relics; there were many bodies there; the fight must
have been a sharp one."</p>

<p>"A hard one it was," said the old man, "albeit I
didna see it&mdash;your friend was betrayed, your own gear
plundered! The <i>collieshangie</i><a name="FNanchor_G_" id="FNanchor_G_"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_" title="Scuffle, or shindy." class="fnanchor">[G]</a> was a fearful one our men
say. The younger of the gentlemen made a stand&mdash;he
was soon done for, and then the Vardarelli, d&mdash;n 'em,
fought for the lassie. Adrian gave Luigi a stab with his
knife that did the business for him, and rode away with
the wench, devil knows where. Luigi, that's the captain,
sughed awa', and he lies in yon box," pointing to
the coffin.</p>

<p>"Wretched man! is he gone to his account? He was
a true ruffian, and this Adrian has escaped! but whose
were all the other bodies?"</p>

<p>"Aweel, I'll tell you&mdash;whilst these two fought like
game cocks, a fleet of those cussed sbirri hove in sight,
and would have overhauled 'em, but the Skipper gave
'em warning&mdash;they fought like born fiends, deil a ane
of the sbirri cleared away, but the Skipper died!"</p>

<p>"A good riddance I think; but how does this concern
me, save that I hear my friends were cruelly murdered,
my property plundered, and the miscreant who did it is
dead?"</p>

<p>"Lift up yon cloth, and take a look at the dead man,"
said Bill, with a cruel smile.</p>

<p>The Earl rose: he approached the table, and first lifting
the swords off, then pushed aside the pall, disclosing
a very handsome coffin elaborately ornamented in inlaid
silver, being itself formed of polished black wood, probably
ebony. Folding the pall he placed it aside, and
then proceeded to raise the lid, which was as yet unscrewed.
A man in full brigand dress, or rather what was
once a man, lay there&mdash;cold, motionless! A white handkerchief
was spread over the features. The Earl paused&mdash;Luigi
was certainly a fine specimen he thought; upwards
of six feet in length, and proportionally broad, his
tall figure was peculiarly well set off by the dress he
wore&mdash;the black jacket, with trimmings of silver, the
scarlet sash in which still were confined his pistols, and
stilettos, black velvet breeches, and black leather buskins;
his arms were folded across his breast, and so lifelike
did the dead man seem, that the Earl paused a moment,
half suspecting that the figure would leap up, and end
the play by confronting him, and daring him to single
combat. Bill Stacy seeing him pause said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lift the napery, and see if ye ken the face."</p>

<p>The Earl did so. Angel of death! who lay there but
John de Vere, his brother? no marvel he started back,&mdash;no
wonder he turned pale. Life like, but dead, he lay
before him. He was little altered since his brother had
last seen him. Crime and bloodshed had given a more
relentless aspect to his face, hotter suns had burned his
complexion still darker, but the eye so fiery scarce closed,
and the stillness of death had given an air of rigidity
to his wild features. A frown had stiffened on his brow,
and the last agony of death had impressed a vengeful
scowl on his lips&mdash;the invariable effect of sword, or
dagger wounds. Yes, that eye was for ever sealed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Still, like a clouded gem, from its dull shroud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lifelessness, its look was high and proud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, though his brow deep melancholy confest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! yet it lacked the air of perfect rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though it wist not where that rest to seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And felt an anguish that it could not speak."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Earl again approached, and gazed steadfastly on
the face of the dead: he then turned away, as if he could
endure the sight no more, and in an altered voice asked
Bill&mdash;</p>

<p>"How came he here? how died he? speak, mysterious
man!"</p>

<p>"I told you Adrian&mdash;that is Ned L'Estrange&mdash;and he
fought for the lassie; Ned stuck his knife in him; that's
how he came here."</p>

<p>"That was Luigi, but L'Estrange you said&mdash;my brain
is addled, what is all this?"</p>

<p>"'Tis plain enough," said Bill; "the Captain was
Luigi, and Ned L'Estrange was Adrian, and Ned, d&mdash;n
him, killed the Captain."</p>

<p>"And this king of robbers, this Luigi, was my brother!
Good God! I had heard he was not what people thought,
little I dreamed who he was! and L'Estrange, Adrian!
That man seems born my evil angel: he ran away with
my betrothed, escaped from justice, and has now killed
my brother! where is he, old man? he dies for my
brother."</p>

<p>"Didna I tell ye he gave leg bail, and has given a
wide berth to old Bill; he kens better than run foul of
him. Cuss him for killing the Cap."</p>

<p>"Luigi my brother! strange, strange," said the Earl,
again approaching the corpse. "Alas, John! to what have
you fallen?&mdash;a brigand, and now perished by the sword
you too well used. Alas! alas! Still with all thy vices,
thou art my brother yet. Death pays all debts but one,
the debt of vengeance, and surely and bloodily thou
shalt be avenged! and now," he continued, addressing
Bill again, "tell me the mystery of her who brought me
here."</p>

<p>"All in good time, my Lord. I have much to tell
you yet; old Bill can spin a long yarn."</p>

<p>"I doubt it not, but delay me no more now; let me
return home, I will come again and hear all to-morrow&mdash;I
give you my promise&mdash;but not now; I must see about
my murdered friends, arrange about the interment of
my poor assassinated brother, set the bloodhounds after
the miscreant who murdered him, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay, not so fast, you can't steer from here before
you know all; when you hear who Ned L'Estrange is
you won't be so keen to follow him. You must stay, I
command you; sit down, sit down: if I whistled the room
were full of those who would make you anchor long
enough; the time is come, I have been revenged, the
murder must out."</p>

<p>"I see I must stay then. In truth I know not how I
could thread my way out&mdash;you will tell me then who that
girl is."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, I see you have a misgiving about the little
craft; they say in the auld country, 'tis a wise bairn who
kens his father, and I say it is a wise father who kens
his ain bairn, and ye may een make what you will from
that. But it will be a long yarn, and you had as well get
something aboard your stomach."</p>

<p>"I can eat nothing," said the Earl; "I pray you begin
at once."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, you had better rouse up first, and weet your
whistle, ye'll need it," and so saying the old man
called: a bandit in full costume entered with wine
and a couple of goblets. When he had retired the old
man poured a goblet full, and handed it to the Earl,
who felt the need of it too strongly to refuse so good an
offer, and drained it off, declaring the wine excellent.
Bill, without the formality of pouring it into the tazza,
put the bottle to his mouth&mdash;it was one of pig's skin&mdash;and
took a long draught; then dragging a cask from beneath
the table he sat down on it; and fixing his eyes on the
Earl, who had reseated himself on the skin-covered ledge,
commenced his narrative. We must however refer the
reader to another chapter, and will also give it in good
English, instead of the mixture of Scotch, sea phrases,
oaths, and various scraps from many countries, in which
it was spun, reserving only a few sea terms, or expressive
words.</p>

<p>"To begin, then, at the commencement I must sail back
many years. I am an old man now, and have had a
rough cruise through life. I was then a young lad just
ready to be launched out on the sea of life; it is forty
years gone by now, but I remember all as if it had happened
yesterday. The Earl of Wentworth, your father,
was then but just of age, and had been celebrating his
majority with great merry-making. On his estates the
chief retainer was a man named Hermiston, the bailiff
of the Dun Edin farm; he was a stout, well-to-do sort of
man, and had one only son and two daughters: that son
was me&mdash;my name was William Hermiston. My mother
had died in giving me birth, and my father and sisters
spoiled me,&mdash;never contradicting me in anything, and
letting me grow up as wild a young scapegrace as was in
all the country round. I got into bad company when
I was about eighteen; idleness is the mother of all mischief,
and so it was with me. I drank, betted, swore,
and as I had plenty of the rhino, and was hail fellow
well met with every companion that knew me, I grew
worse and worse. My old father used often to say a
word: he would shake his head and tell me he feared I
would come to no good with such companions, but I
heeded not what the old man said, and went on the
same. In the publics I became acquainted with some
horse-racing fellows, and was soon at home in the betting
way, and could make a book with any man. I ran into
debt&mdash;or as we say at sea, outstripped the constable&mdash;they
were debts of honour, and had to be paid. My father
steadily refused to refund me any more; I applied to
your father, he helped me out easily, but warned me not
to expect any future aid. Again I got head over ears&mdash;money
must be got, and I became acquainted with a set
of wild fellows&mdash;smugglers. I had always been fond of
the sea, and took to the trade readily. Full of risk and
danger, it was exactly what I liked; I rapidly made headway,
paid my score, and rose to be one of the leading men.</p>

<p>"By the time I was five-and-twenty, or thereabout,
I was captain of a lugger craft, and well known as a
desperate fellow. When my old father heard of my evil
doings he sternly reprimanded me for the first time in
my life. I was not able to brook censure, and told him
so; he tried entreaty, all was vain. I left him and
brought down his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
My voyages were never very far, Holland was the extent
of them at that time, and I had a magnet at home which
kept me ever coming back; this was a young and pretty
girl, who lived near Musselburgh; her name was Agnes
Macgregor, and a finer lass I never saw. I had known
her for years, and she had long been my sweetheart; she
had no father or mother, and her grandmother was an
old, decrepit, blind woman of seventy, so the girl was
under little restraint. Many's the time I have walked
and talked with her for hours in the evenings when I
was ashore; she did not care a straw about the illicit
course of life I led, nay, I think she thought all the
better of me for it. I left her, as I was to go to Flushing
first before our marriage, and promised to bring home
lace enough to deck her out like a queen. I remember
well how she waved her kerchief to me as our craft put
off at moonlight. I thought on her all the way over the
rough German Ocean&mdash;it was winter time, and a bitter
nor'-easter blew in our teeth, with driving sleet and hail.
I reached Holland; I got the very finest lace for Agnes.
I left again with a rich cargo, and landed in the old
country. I had been absent some three months, winter
had changed and spring set in; more than winter had
changed, too&mdash;I found woman as variable as the seasons.
I went to seek her at the old house&mdash;it was empty. I
inquired&mdash;they had removed to a cottage near the Towers.
I followed, I found her out&mdash;the hussy would have
nought to say to me. In vain I argued, in vain I tried
to get back her heart, it was all no go. I tried to find a
reason for the change; she only gave one I would not
receive&mdash;my manner of life, my being a smuggler. I
loved that girl as I loved my own life; I offered to give
up all, and seek an honest livelihood; all to no purpose,
the wench had no more to say to me, and I was miserable.</p>

<p>"My Lord, you may look at my old weather-beaten
features, and wonder any woman would look at me, but
I was a well-favoured youngster then. I could put the
stone, toss the caber, leap, run, and vault against any
young fellow in the county. I was not the sour-faced,
hard-featured seaman I am now, and I knew the girl once
did love me, and dearly, and I resolved to wait and see
what the cause of quarrel really was. But I had to put
again to sea. I was away from home nearly a year and
a half, but when I came home my ears were assailed right
and left with the very thing I had feared&mdash;the girl I had
promised myself for a wife had been deceived by one in
the upper ranks of life; she had fallen, unable to resist
the temptation of following one rich, handsome, and
with a proud name&mdash;he was to be preferred as a lover,
before William Hermiston as a husband. He gave her
money, handsome dresses, jewels, everything but an
honest name and fame, but she could well afford to want
them if she had all the conceits a girl's head runs on.
In a word she was the dupe of a nobleman. I sought
the cottage where I had seen her last: the old woman
was there, not the granddaughter; from her I learned
who her beguiler had been, and where she then lived.
My Lord, it was your father, the young Earl of Wentworth;
and he had given her well-furnished apartments
near Edinburgh. The Earl had been married more
than three years, and he had two children, a little girl
and a boy about two years: he visited Agnes on the sly,
and only occasionally.</p>

<p>"When I learned all this I almost died with passion. I felt
a very devil of vengeance enter into my heart. The pride
of my soul, the light of my eyes, my love, my destined wife,
had been tempted, betrayed, and was now living in guilty
splendour. My Lord, see the misery that light loves in
high rank bring on the lower class. Your father was
rich, powerful, noble by birth and name, possessed of lands,
wife, children,&mdash;and his evil conduct robbed the poor
man of all; surely this was a case of the rich man who
took the poor man's lamb&mdash;the tale I used to hear of sometimes
when I was a boy. And mark the consequences&mdash;ah!
you great people little think the pretty and innocent
girl you pick up, and deck out in finery, is perhaps the
only love of some honest, poor man, whose whole life is
altered by their crime. Such was the case with me.
Owing to your father's choice, I was made a very demon,
and the cause of misery untold, not only to the hapless
girl herself, but to your own family. Oh! I loved that
girl as I once loved heaven. I lost my heaven in her,
and lose Heaven by her."</p>

<p>The old man here paused to rub away the unbidden
tear with his rough sleeve. The Earl, deeply interested,
and feeling a home thrust in the narrative of his father's
folly, bent forward, but spoke not.</p>

<p>"When I found out the true reason of her change, I
hurried to see her. Your father had rented a cottage a
short way from Edinburgh for her home; I went there,&mdash;it
was a Saturday night, I remember; I watched and
saw the Earl's carriage drive from the door. I did no
more that night,&mdash;her guilt was now sure, and her deceiver
too. On Sunday morning, when her servant was at
church, I called: she opened the door, and when she saw
me would have shut it in my face, but I pressed in.
Her room was elegantly furnished; she was splendidly
dressed; her dress enhanced her beauty; she never looked
more lovely; and when I thought she might have been
mine a demon rose in my breast. I know not what I
said, save that I called her every vile name I could think
of, and she bandied high words too, and bade me begone
and leave her to mind herself and her baby. I had not
dreamed of that. I turned and saw a cradle, and therein
her firstborn child; it was a fair boy, but the devil was
in me. The house was lone, every one at church, no
human being near. I rushed to the cradle, and seizing
the hapless babe, I dashed its infant brains out against
the grate."</p>

<p>He paused: the Earl's face grew pale as he exclaimed,
"Inhuman monster! you avow such a deed!"</p>

<p>"Ay, my Lord, reproach me, I deserve it; but see
what came of stolen affections. I shall never forget the
harrowing scream of Agnes, it was the most awful
shriek of heartbroken agony I ever heard, it rings in my
ears still. She then fell in a senseless swoon on the floor.
The foul fiend prompted me&mdash;I heard him speak as
though he was beside me&mdash;I looked for a weapon&mdash;the
first I saw was a carving-knife on the sideboard. I
whetted it against the fender in diabolical rage&mdash;I knew
not what I did&mdash;I rushed on my prostrate victim,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wretched old sinner paused again, the drops stood
on his brow, his face was contorted with evil passions as
he thought on the deed.</p>

<p>"You cruelly murdered her, you bloodthirsty villain,"
said the Earl.</p>

<p>"I did; I nigh severed her head from her body. Ah!
that was sweet revenge. When I had done the deed of
hell I rushed from the spot as if all the fiends chased me.
There was no need&mdash;no mortal saw me, and ere the double
murder was found out I was miles away. I ran for the
Towers, intending to go and tell your father what I had
done, and give myself up to the gallows. Life had
nothing more endurable. I reached the Towers about
three in the afternoon; I asked to see the Earl on important
business. He was at church; I said I would stroll
about the grounds till he came home. I wandered by
the dell at the side of the park, and, sitting down on a
fallen log, began to think on my cruel deed, and its
inevitable result&mdash;the gallows. Presently I heard voices,
and saw a servant-girl leading a little boy, of perhaps two
years old, by the hand. She came on till she was nearly
opposite me, when I heard a whistle, and saw the girl
leave the child, and run to speak with a young forester
some hundred yards off, who had given the signal. A
plan of terrible revenge entered my head. I knew it was
the little Viscount, the only son of him who had wrought
my misery: it was the work of a second, the thought
suggested by the Evil One, and putting it into prompt
action, like a boa I rushed on my prey, seized the
child up in my arms, choked its cries with my kerchief,
and dived into the copse-wood towards the burn, which
was then swollen with flood: I then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold!" said the Earl, "you were then the murderer
of my eldest brother, and despite the consequences,
you die for it."</p>

<p>He sprung up as if to wrestle with his foe. The old
man moved not a muscle of his face, but exclaimed,
"Are you mad? A cry from me brings a score of ruffians.
Are you crazed? I did <i>not</i> murder your brother,
I harmed not a hair of his head."</p>

<p>"Then, in God's name, what did you do?"</p>

<p>"Patience and you shall hear; interrupt me no
more."</p>

<p>"I could listen for ever&mdash;it rivets me. Go on&mdash;I am
breathless."</p>

<p>"I then plunged into the burn with my burden, and
waded for a hundred paces or so; then I hid in a hollow
tree and awaited the result. I heard the nurse
cry, and saw her and the youth seek everywhere in
vain. They passed and repassed my hiding-place, and
then sought down the opposite way. I came forth and
again proceeded a quarter of a mile, when I reached an
old ruin, where I stayed till gloaming came on, and
then hurried to a ken where my smuggling friends
lurked. I told them nought of the murder, but said
the child was only the son of a nobleman who wished
me to get rid of it. That evening I started with the
boy, and was taken on board a privateer, then in Leith
Roads. My character was well known, and I got a
place as master on board. The vessel's name was the
'Black Mail.' We weighed anchor and sailed for America.
It was then the time of the French Revolution,
and all the countries of Europe were leagued against
France. We kept up a half privateering, half smuggling
business for some years, in which I gradually rose
to become the captain of the 'Black Mail.'</p>

<p>"About that time our country declared war against
Spain, and we had a rare time of it. I cared neither for my
own life nor the lives of my men; and under the name of
Mad Helder&mdash;for I changed my name&mdash;I gained a bloody
notoriety amongst the privateering gentlemen. Our
vessel was well named; she was a smart little schooner,
with raking masts and heavy ordnance, and exacted
black mail on friend and foe for seven years. Then our
vessel grew a common nuisance; we were a set of desperadoes.
Young Viscount de Vere, under the name of
Dick Foundling, grew up amongst such a set a proper
young rascal; he lisped oaths ere he could speak plainly;
he drank gin when he should have drunk milk. He
was the pet of all the crew, had a deal of pluck in him,
and learned to use knife and pistol, ere he could have
reached the age of eight, as if he had been an old hand!
When he was nine, one evening we were running down
for Cuba under full sail, a British frigate, the 'Arethusa,'
hove in sight, and immediately gave chase. The 'Black
Mail,' had the wind continued steady, would have laughed
at her, but the breeze failed us, and the 'Arethusa' being
a taller rigged vessel, caught it later than we did, and
soon bore down on us. She fired a round shot across
our bows, and ordered us to show our colours. Up went
our black flag, and we gave them a dose of black shot
with it; but she was game at that, my Lord; and shot
and shell she poured into us till we began to settle
down. Knowing we should get no quarter, we stuck
out, and determined to die to a man. They boarded us,
and a terrible hand-to-hand fight we had of it. I got
the slash whose scar you see across my figure head
there; it stunned me; I fell as they thought dead, and
remember no more till I awoke from my swoon, found
myself in the water, struck out, and soon ran foul of a
piece of the wreck of the 'Black Mail,' and dragged
myself aboard of it. It was a dark night, but I saw the
lights of the 'Arethusa' half a league to leeward; they
had not seen me, and I had drifted away. There was a
strong current there.</p>

<p>"All night I sat on the wreck; it was a warm night,
and I took off part of my soaked clothes and spread them
to dry. Morning came, the frigate's top-gallants just
peeped over the horizon. The sun rose hot; the blood
clotted on my brow; I was hungry, faint, parched with
thirst. I drank the salt water, it only made me worse. I
strained my eyes in vain to catch a sail. I picked up a
spar during the day, and had sufficient strength to set it
up on the part of the stern on which I was left. I spread
my sailor's coat for a sail, and soon began to move! I knew
nor cared not where, so I drifted ashore or bore down
in sight of a vessel. All that day and the next night I
was left without food or water: the thirst was like fire. I
began to think all was up, and I should have to give in,
and actually thought of drowning myself. I had almost
despaired when a vessel appeared; I had just
strength to take off my shirt and hang it up as a signal
of distress, and attracted their attention. They picked
me up in the last extremity of existence. She proved
a British ship, a merchantman, bound from Vera Cruz
to India. I told a tale of having been a captain of an
English ship knocked to pieces by a Spaniard, and was
believed. My wound and wants were attended to, and
as the master had lately died of Yellow Jack, I got his
place, for my knowledge of seamanship was great, and
I knew all the currents and pilotage of the West
Indian isles well, and this was what they needed then.</p>

<p>"It was an evil day they took me aboard. Wild at
the loss of my ship and men, specially of young Dick
Foundling, I burned to revenge it on British ships. I
could not abide too being under orders, and I soon
stirred up the sailors to mutiny. I got nearly the whole
crew on my side, and we murdered the captain, officers,
and all who would not join us. Some we hung, some
we tossed to the sharks, some we made walk the plank,
and we pelted the skipper to death with glass bottles!
I was unanimously chosen captain. I put in at a
French port under French colours, sold the cargo, and
in return got aboard guns, cutlasses, and all kinds of
warlike gear. Terribly did I revenge my loss. Many a
noble vessel went to the bottom. We led a wild life of
it for fourteen years, and then all was lost by shipwreck.</p>

<p>"War with America had again broken out, and I
was trying to cut off English vessels going up the St.
Lawrence. We were chased by a man-of-war, and overtaken
in one of those dense fogs. It was near winter,
and the icebergs were frequent; the cold was awful!
every sea that broke over us turned to ice; the decks
were like glass. The man-of-war sheered off, and we
were tossed amidst the ice-fields, and wrecked on Labrador.
We made a fire of drift-wood, and got what provisions
we could from the wreck, but my men were frozen
at the fire; a hurricane of wind almost blew away the
very embers, and we commenced a march over the frozen
plains. The wolves and the frost thinned our numbers,
and I and another man only reached civilized country.
The devil seemed to uphold me through everything for
his own purposes, and my strong frame seemed invincible.
We, the sad relics of a crew of two hundred
brave fellows, reached Nain, a small settlement, where
we stayed out the dreadful winter. There was a small
English man-of-war wintering there. One of the sailors
happened to have been a lad on board the 'Arethusa:'
we got great chums, and amongst other yarns he told
me the fight they had had with the 'Black Mail,' little
knowing I had been its captain. I did not undeceive
him, but I learned what I least expected, and that was
the boy, your brother, had been picked up. 'He
fought,' he said, 'like a fiend incarnate;' but by-and-by
was tamed and kindly treated by our Captain, who took
a great fancy to him, and adopted him for his own son,
giving him the name of Edward L'Estrange."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried the Earl. "Edward L'Estrange
my lost brother? I know his history now. Ha! that
accounts for the singular resemblance he had to the
Captain. Heaven above! this is indeed wonderful.
But go on."</p>

<p>"Well," said Bill, "I determined to find the youngster
out; for my mate could tell me no more, as he had
been drafted to another ship. So I set off as soon as
I could to Canada, intending to take a passage home,
and find if he still lived. I reached Quebec; several
regiments were then wintering there, and I thought
perhaps I might learn something about him. There was
also another reason I had for going thither. Many
years before I had overhauled a Spanish ship; there
was on board a rich Don, Ramond, a passenger, and he
had an only child with him, Carlotta, a pretty, black-eyed
little wench of five years old or so. The old Don,
when dying,&mdash;for he got mortally wounded,&mdash;commended
this girl with his dying breath to me, the
captain of the enemy that had conquered his ship. I
had a liking to the girl, and took her to America when
I next sailed there, and left her to be brought up by a
sister of mine, who was living there with her husband.
I had not seen this girl for twelve years, and I was
anxious to see if she had grown up handsome. I was
then known by the name of Bill Stacy, or Dare-devil
Bill, and the girl had been called Antonia Stacy.</p>

<p>"Part of the Rifle Brigade was then at Quebec, and I
heard there was an officer, Lieutenant L'Estrange, there.
On inquiries I found out it was the same one I was
seeking. He had been educated by the Commodore
L'Estrange, who had bought him a commission in the
army; and he had already fought in the Peninsula. I
found Antonia grown a handsome girl of seventeen;
and I thought I should like to bring about a marriage
between them. I enlisted in the same regiment, and in
two years had risen to be a serjeant. I told L'Estrange
so much of my history as to let him know I only was
able to give him a clue to his early life, wrapt in
mystery; and I introduced him to Antonia. But the
two did not cotton together. There was another young
man in the same regiment, named George Ravensworth,
who greatly admired my prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. He had picked her
out of the St. Lawrence when her boat couped one evening.
I told him she was of the very best blood in Spain;
and, as I was anxious to get a good husband for her,
and the two loved each other so well, I should not have
minded their getting spliced. But our battalion was
ordered to New Orleans, where we made an unsuccessful
attempt to take the place; and there young Ravensworth
took Yellow Jack and died. He and L'Estrange
were the greatest chums possible; and his death nigh
broke two hearts. He begged L'Estrange to carry a
few relics to his bereaved family; and he said he would.</p>

<p>"War was then over; peace with America declared;
and our men reached Europe in time for the grand final
success of Wellington at Waterloo. After the Peace of
Paris we came home. I got my discharge and settled
near Brighton. I got to my old ways, and Bill Stacy's
cabin was as well known as the Pavilion. L'Estrange had
exchanged into the 7th Hussars before Waterloo;
they were quartered at Edinburgh. He took the sword
of George Ravensworth to his sister, a fine girl of sixteen.
By-and-by they were engaged to marry; but
your Lordship best knows why that marriage never came
off! Part of the 7th were at Brighton. Amongst
other officers, whom my tobacco, wines, or Antonia
magnetized, was John de Vere, who now lies dead
beside us. He met me in a row in Brighton, in which
Sir Richard Musgrave joined, and used to get wines and
tobacco to a great extent from the cabin.</p>

<p>"When L'Estrange found Ellen Ravensworth had jilted
him for your Lordship, he was very miserable, and came
one night to ask my counsel on his best proceedings. That
night Captain de Vere was with me, and I could have
laughed in my sleeve to see the brothers sitting so near,
and yet not knowing their relationship. They were so
like that it was a joke in the regiment; but the Captain
was the firmest in character, and soon overcame
L'Estrange's scruples, and we made our first plot to
prevent your Lordship's union with the present Countess.
Our plan was to set Antonia in your way; we
knew your weakness for the other sex, and determined
to storm you on the salient angle. Your marriage was
gall and wormwood to your brother De Vere; and this
was his reason for combating it. Antonia was dressed,
and taught her part; apartments opposite your house
chosen; and the Captain drew your attention to her.
You know the rest. Under the name of Juana Ferraras
she was imposed on you. It was a double cheat; she
was assured she would become a Countess, or would
never have submitted; and we hoped your Lordship
would take such a fancy to her as to take her with you
to Scotland, when we would threaten to prove a Scotch
marriage; and we knew you would rather remain unwed
than acknowledge it; so that Ellen Ravensworth would
be free to return to L'Estrange, and the Captain would
have no family to cut him out of the title. We then
put a paragraph in the papers, stating your marriage
would soon take place with Lady Alice Claremont, the
Marquis's sister, thinking it would disgust Miss Ravensworth.
The bait took; and she nearly died, as you
know; but, unluckily for us, she met the Marchioness
abroad, and all the murder came out. Your Lordship,
too, grew tired of Juana, and the first plot proved a
total failure. But the Captain had more than one string
to his bow, and we began a second one."</p>

<p>The old man paused, and again had recourse to the
pigskin of wine. The Earl hid his face in his hands to
conceal his emotions, at thus finding out what a system
of deceit, treachery, espionage had been carried on by
those he had loved, and did not even dream capable of
such duplicity! The mystery was gradually being
cleared up; the complications unravelled; and he saw
things in a new light. He felt angry at having been
made, as it were, a catspaw; sorry that he had given
zest to their wickedness by his own weakness; and a
feeling of uncontrollable disgust at the narrator was only
veiled by his interest in the story, and his desire to
know how all would end. He dared not speak his
suspicions, and yet he felt sure they would all be verified;
so he determined to listen, but ask no questions.</p>

<p>After a slight pause, as if to rest, the old man resumed
his story; but as his yarn is altogether too long
for one chapter, we must divide it into two, being well
aware, from personal experience, that long chapters
weary the reader, whilst the same amount of narrative,
subdivided with discretion, is less apt to pall, or become
tedious to the peruser.</p>

<p>"Your Lordship," continued the old sailor, "when
tired of Juana pensioned her off, gave her apartments
in London, and a handsome allowance, provided she
would never more seek after or speak to you again.
You then went to Scotland, and soon after your arrival
there Miss Ravensworth returned and met you. I was
sent by the Captain to hire the Peel of Cessford as a
house in which Juana might reside, and Sir Richard
Musgrave was enrolled as a conspirator also.</p>

<p>"The Captain, L'Estrange, and he, had an interview
with Juana: the two former left for Scotland to visit
your Lordship; Sir Richard and the girl followed.
Our second plan was to let Miss Ravensworth believe you
were married, and if she would not credit it show Juana.
L'Estrange called on the young lady and hinted it,
even showed your letters to Juana, but she would not
read them; indeed, she destroyed them, and seemed
rather to love you the better, as many girls do love
unsteady men with the hope of reforming them.
Whilst I and the girl Juana were at Cessford's Peel, a
picnic, or some such mummery, was made to the ruins, and
the Captain, though very angry at it at first, tried to
turn the mischance to good account.</p>

<p>"Juana was dressed as an Italian minstrel and taught
a part to play; it was thought likely you would, with
your usual hospitality, give her a shelter at the Towers,
and L'Estrange was then to show Miss Ravensworth
how false you were to her, in harbouring the girl thus
in disguise, whilst paying her attentions. This plan
was overthrown in a curious way; Juana followed you
and the lady up the wood to a cave, where she heard
you propose, and Miss Ravensworth accept, on the condition
you never afterwards spoke to <i>her</i>. I said she
was deluded by a false hope of becoming a Countess:
now she saw things in a new light, and absolutely refused
to go to the Towers. That night, after much
trouble, the Captain prevailed on L'Estrange to try the
third scheme: he was to disappear mysteriously, and a
rumour to be got abroad he had met with foul play.
Suspicion was to be thrown on Miss Ravensworth, and,
under disguise of officers of the King, we were to carry
her to Cessford's Peel, and force her to marry L'Estrange.
Sir Richard Musgrave acted his part well as officer, and,
as you know, she was carried off: I and Farmer Forbes
and his son played a part too as assistants. No clue
would ever have been found, till we had terrified Miss
Ravensworth into submission, had Juana not found out
she was sister to her old lover, George Ravensworth.
She went and betrayed us on the very night things
were to be brought to an issue.</p>

<p>"The Captain and I accompanied L'Estrange to the
girl's room, and then left him to settle it with his sweetheart:
it appeared he had little fancy for it, and had
made the preconcerted signal for assistance, when the
Captain saw your Lordship and several others in sight!
He and I fled by secret passages, and whilst I lay <i>cach&eacute;</i>,
he joined your party with the utmost coolness, and
assisted in binding L'Estrange, whispering him he was
true under false colours, as well as threatening Miss
Ravensworth and Juana with his vengeance if they inculpated
him. When L'Estrange was in prison, the
night before his trial the Captain visited his cell at midnight,
and gave him a file and rope to make his escape
with, whilst I and young Forbes waited for him in the
Hunter's Bog; it was a terrible night of thunder and
lightning, but he made his escape, and that night he
and I sailed for Germany. He was pretty hard up for
money then, and not long after he married a Polish
lady, the Countess Czinsky, whose name he assumed.
But he never loved her, and cared only for her money,
and when the Captain, after having shot Musgrave, joined
him, they both left for St. Petersburgh.</p>

<p>"It was about this time Juana gave birth to a daughter,
Leonora,&mdash;who brought you here; she died soon after, and
I often thought she had met with foul play; this afternoon
her murderer confessed he had poisoned her in
revenge for her treachery&mdash;there he lies&mdash;he was a bad
man! About the time of Christmas, a year afterwards,
L'Estrange, still hankering after his old lady-love, hearing
from Archy Forbes the Countess was living in
retirement at the Towers, proposed reconnoitring, and if
practicable carrying her off. The Captain did not much
admire the plan, thinking it impossible, but we came
across, and he rode up to see how matters stood. The
news had been false, the Towers were full, so we
weighed sail, and were off in our schooner in the
very dirtiest night of snow and storm I ever recollect.
We had intended to go straight to Naples, but cruised
down Africa, and getting aboard some Algerines, tried
our hand at the slave trade a year or two, and took
many a black cargo across to the West Indies, but we
grew sick o' that, and having a good ballast of shiners
went to Italy. From that time the Captain and L'Estrange
became brigands, and taking the name of Vardarelli,
a name famous, inspiring fear in every bosom,
carried on a successful trade. This morning they made
an attack on an Englishman going to visit your Lordship
at Foggia, and carrying rich jewels. I have already
told you the rest."</p>

<p>The old man ceased his narrative, and again took a
long draught of wine. For some moments the Earl
moved not nor spoke. Tumultuous thoughts disturbed
his mind, and he scarce knew what to say, or how to
express his surprise at thus listening to the long records
of conspiracy, plot, and crime he had been exposed to
by his nearest relatives. He felt now inclined to disbelieve
the whole story, now half doubting; and then
his position,&mdash;the whole scene around seemed to verify
the old man's tale.</p>

<p>"Whoever you may really be," said the Earl, "your
story is one of the blackest villanies I ever heard; the
actors seem to have been allied with the Evil One. And
yet, what proof have I this is not an ingeniously devised
tale? I must have proofs."</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_H_" id="FNanchor_H_"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_" title="N.B.--Having dropped Bill Stacy's lingo, we shall not reintroduce it.--J.S." class="fnanchor">[H]</a>"And you shall. Old Bill would but half have done
his work had he no proofs,&mdash;there, my Lord (taking a
bundle of papers), there lie the proofs. Those papers
are signed by all the actors in my tale, and are no forgeries;
you may examine them at your leisure."</p>

<p>The Earl took the parcel and secreted it beneath his
cloak; then, rising once more, approached the mortal
remains of John de Vere; once more he looked on the
brother of his youth, and could scarce believe him
capable of such atrocities. What a life had his been!
The wild, cruel boy had grown up the careless, dare-devil,
vicious, young man, the infamous desperado whose
power and malice terrified the whole of Southern Italy!
But death pays all debts, says the poet, and even here
it hid a multitude of sins. There were softer memories
connected with the departed: He had been the child
who had shared his childish amusements; the youth with
whom he had hunted, ridden, and shot; the young man
with whom he shared many a scene of joy or danger.
In these associations he forgot how, while he ate his
bread, he had been intriguing against him; how he had
plotted to procure his misery, and, by unparalleled
dissimulation, seemed his friend whilst he was his worst
foe,&mdash;despite all, he was his brother still. The fixed eye,
the pale brow, the lifeless face asked his pity; the tears
started in the good Earl's eyes as he bent over all that
was once John Captain de Vere, and it was some time
ere he could frame the question:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At least you will allow me to procure Christian
burial for my poor brother?"</p>

<p>"It is impossible," said old Bill; "by the rules of this
band he must be buried here, with all our rites. You
must forget you had a brother; he will sleep as soundly
here as in a marble tomb."</p>

<p>"By what right do you deny me my proper power?
Surely it rests with me to inter my own brother."</p>

<p>"I know not by what right saving the right of might.
You are not lord here, but I am."</p>

<p>"But, my fine fellow, I will soon assert my power;
let me once get free from this accursed nest of robbers,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you will not get free, my Lord, till you have
solemnly sworn you will never divulge our hiding place,
nor strive to find it out."</p>

<p>"Your terms are hard, yet I have no resource but to
submit to numbers, though I dare try you all had I fair
play one by one."</p>

<p>"You will not be put to the test, but, after you have
taken the oath, will leave as you came, and need only
think of all this as a wild dream. Your brothers need
not trouble you; one is dead, and will be buried with
due pomp; the other is an outcast even from outcasts,
and will know better than to show his face in these
quarters."</p>

<p>"You said my brother, as I must call Edward
L'Estrange, married. Had he any family? For if he
had, it would seriously affect my position. As it is, I
must take the highest legal advice, and see if this is all
reliable evidence."</p>

<p>"You need not fear about your title or possessions;
no son of Edward L'Estrange's will ever trouble you."</p>

<p>"Then he had no family?" said the Earl.</p>

<p>"I never said so; but you're free to think what you
will."</p>

<p>"But tell me, had he a son, or daughter?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I may tell what I please, and needn't tell
what I don't."</p>

<p>"But for God's sake tell me the truth!"</p>

<p>"I never have told you aught but the truth."</p>

<p>"I gain, from your unwillingness to tell me, he had
a child; was the marriage an acknowledged one?"</p>

<p>"The marriage was sure enough; there is the certificate
with the papers I gave you; but as to whether they
had children or not, you may even think what you will."</p>

<p>Lord Wentworth, seeing he should gain nothing on
this subject by further inquiry, dropped it, inwardly
wondering at the old man's contumacy.</p>

<p>"I have said my say," said Bill Stacy, "and now I
have only to get your oath you will never by word or
deed directly or indirectly betray our retreat or ourselves,
and you may go."</p>

<p>"Old man," said the Earl, "I give my promise I will
by no means directly or indirectly betray either you,
your comrades, or your den; but I do not pledge myself
to make no inquiries about Edward L'Estrange."</p>

<p>"You are quite free to do that, but I'll warrant you
will scarce find him. He is a sly fox is Edward
L'Estrange, and won't put his head into the snare if he
knows it."</p>

<p>"Then I am free to go, and you will at least allow me
to return with my child,&mdash;the unhappy child of her I so
ill treated,&mdash;and let her be brought up away from scenes
and men ill suited to her age and sex."</p>

<p>"You must promise more in that case. The girl shall
pilot you back to the place she brought you from; but
she must then and there leave you. You must swear
that also."</p>

<p>"What! Am I not to have my way with my own
child? You trespass on the rights of nature, and because
I am now in the power of evil men, exert an undue and
mean advantage over me."</p>

<p>"I am not here to argue whether it is right or not
right. You are the prisoner here, and must abide by
my terms if you wish your freedom. In Scotland they
say, 'He is a proud beggar who names his alms,' and he
is a proud prisoner who makes his own terms, I may
add."</p>

<p>"On my soul this is enough to drive a man mad.
Here I am, curbed and fettered on all sides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My Lord, you have too long been accustomed to rule,
and to see everybody obey you. It is good to be under
the yoke sometimes. Will you swear to abide by your
promise neither to betray our resort, nor by any means
win Leonora to follow you? Indeed the girl knows
better than to do so, and if you tried to carry her off,
neither your name, rank, nor riches should save you; so
I warn you not to try. Do you swear?"</p>

<p>"I give my word I will not."</p>

<p>"Nay, but you must swear."</p>

<p>"Old man, were I capable of breaking my word, I
were capable of breaking my oath too!"</p>

<p>"It matters not; you cannot leave without swearing."</p>

<p>"Listen; a peer of England, even in Court, swears
only by his honour. You little know the worth of a
peer's word; his pledged, inviolate word is the most
solemn promise he can give. I give that, and my oath
were not a surer pledge."</p>

<p>"I believe you. You may then go. Good night, my
Lord. You will never again see me; but be sure of
this, it was only the hospitality, the goodness, and generosity
of your character saved you too from falling a
victim to my snares. I can see and approve the better,
whilst I follow the worse. I have not forgot that in my
school-training. Farewell!"</p>

<p>"Farewell," said the Earl, as the old man disappeared
behind the black curtain once more, "and I shall not
offend you by wishing you may turn to some better
occupation."</p>

<p>When Bill had disappeared, the Earl sat down, and,
bending his eyes on the ground, he began to recapitulate in
his mind the extraordinary events and the <i>&eacute;claircissement</i>
he had heard that evening, whilst he waited for
his guide. His thoughts also reverted to the Countess as
he looked at his watch, and found it was not very far
from nine o'clock, and he began to think she would indeed
have cause for anxiety. From his reverie he was
awoke by a soft foot approaching, and, looking up, he
saw Leonora close beside him. She seemed to read in
his face he knew the secret, and as he exclaimed, "Leonora,
my child," threw herself into her father's arms.</p>

<p>"And you know now who I am, and why I loved you
so well, and are come to take me from this dreadful
place?"</p>

<p>"Alas! my child, I do know who you are; I do know
you are my daughter, child of one who was worthy
better things than my false love, and believe me, I shall
ever dearly regard you as such. But I cannot, much as I
wish it, take you from this bad place; I have given my
word I will not by any means entice you to leave
with me."</p>

<p>"And why did you give your promise?"</p>

<p>"Without it I should not be able to leave this cave;
it was extorted from me, Leonora; but as I have given
my word I cannot, under any pretext, break it, and did
I do so, I believe in this lawless country it would be of
little avail. But at least, Leonora, you know you have
one who loves you dearly, and if ever you are without a
friend, you have a friend and a father in me."</p>

<p>A shadow of deep disappointment passed over Leonora's
brow.</p>

<p>"It is too bad!" she cried, striking her hands together
with Italian gesture. "What power has that cruel, bad,
relentless man over me? Dark and cruel as my uncle
there was" (pointing to the coffin), "he was not so dreadful
as the old man; but I will run away! I will throw
myself on the King's protection and yours! I will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, Leonora, for heaven's sake! you will be overheard.
At least so far I will stoutly defend you as a
suppliant; but to-night it must not be; for, dear as you
are,&mdash;dearly as I should love to see you ever beside me,
and thus in a way pay back the debt of gratitude the
Countess and I owe to your mother,&mdash;I must not do more
than follow you home to-night; but shall, you may be
sure, try all expedients on your behalf that do not in
any way compromise my honor given."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will, my father," said Leonora, pressing
his hand to her lips. "I do so long to see my
sister, that I feel quite sad at the delay; and I so long
to show how I will love you, and the Countess, and
Lady Augusta, that to be obliged to stay here among
murderers and wicked men is very sad."</p>

<p>"It is indeed, my child; but we will pray that God
will overrule it to your advantage. And now I must
ask you to hasten my departure, or else my wife and
your sister will grow quite alarmed: we have a long
way to travel, and shall have plenty of time to speak by
the way."</p>

<p>"You must then be blindfolded again&mdash;you will not
fear your guide's faith now?" said the young girl, as she
drew the scarf across her arm and folded it, with a sad
smile.</p>

<p>"I shall not, indeed; but first I must take a parting
glance at my poor misguided brother. Ah, Leonora!
you cannot think what different feelings arise in my
mind as I look on that cold form. As each of my race
fall away in their prime, a link is broken&mdash;a blank,
nothing can fill, made; and it seems like a warning
voice to me that my turn must soon come!&mdash;that I
should be preparing for my last change. I hope I am
prepared, Leonora: and how I hope we shall all be
brought to the narrow pleasant paths of righteousness!
To-day I have lost and found a brother; and it makes
my heart bleed to think what and who he is. But I
forgot&mdash;you know nothing of these things: how much I
seem to have before me!"</p>

<p>Intently, for some time after he had ceased speaking,
did the Earl gaze on the face that was dead. His
thoughts are unutterable&mdash;not to be written: that they
were intense and burning his face showed; the expression
sometimes approached to that of torture,&mdash;as if he
was forced to credit what he least wished to believe.</p>

<p>He laid his hand on the marble brow of his brother;
its coldness shot a thrill through his frame; and then
he turned away as though utterly cast down, and sickened
in heart and soul, and with a choking voice bade
Leonora bind the scarf across his eyes, glad to have the
sight veiled from his view. As he stooped to allow the
maiden to do so, she heard him sigh deeply; and, as she
bound the Indian fabric across his eyes, she saw more
than one heavy tear glide down his cheek, and drop
on the folds of her scarf. She felt an answering weakness
within herself, and the tears flowed faster down her
cheek, as she took her parent's hand and led him on
silently.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken either by the Earl or Leonora
during their passage through the same long caves by
which they had entered. The heart of each was too
full for speech. Poor Leonora's dreams of liberation from
a life she abhorred were for the present gone. It was,
perhaps, the worst and darkest hour her young life had
yet met. The shadow of the first cloud seems dreariest,
as it sweeps over the sun-lit meadows; the darkness of
the first sorrow is deepest, as it spreads a shadow over
youth's sunny brow. By-and-by the eye gets accustomed
to the frequent clouds; and in later years the stream of
sorrows, often passing over the heart, leaves such a stony
track behind, the quickness of its sensitiveness is destroyed,
calloused, deadened; and what would once have
crushed, scarce draws forth a passing sigh.</p>

<p>Whatever were Leonora's feelings, they were then
fresh, poignant, and her woe seemed almost heavier
than she could bear. Still she had a consolation;&mdash;she
had hope! Hope that better, brighter days were
in store; hope that rose buoyant over the waves of
sorrow: and she was in this the happiest of the
twain!</p>

<p>Lord Wentworth's thoughts were darker. It was but
an hour or two since he had tracked the path he now
trode: but in that hour what a mass of strange adventure
and harsh truth had been compressed! That space
of time had been the most remarkable era in his life;
that hour or two had not only enlightened him on the
past in a way he could not have dreamed of, but, as it
were, undone all his life. He left that cave a different
man; all his ideas&mdash;all his thoughts&mdash;had undergone a
change. As the earthquake in a few dread moments
overturns the labours of centuries, so had the tale he
had listened to overthrown the structure of his mental
economy. Not only had a system of intrigue been divulged,
but he had been shown how, unwittingly, he
had sailed all his life under false colours. The real
Earl of Wentworth he was no longer; it had been no
fault of his, but he felt he was not any more the man
he had been, and he felt displeased that he had so long
usurped a false character.</p>

<p>Then he had been made the residuary of a secret in
such a questionable way he scarce knew what to think.
He had only to destroy those fatal papers, forge an
excuse for his absence, live as he had lived, and no
being would ever be the wiser;&mdash;or, if the treason did
come out, it would be impossible to furnish proofs.
The Earl banished such thoughts almost as soon as
created in his mind, as unworthy of him. Come what
might, he would ever be the true man!&mdash;he could not
endure the thought of bearing a false reputation, or depriving
another of his rights.</p>

<p>He would do nothing rashly: calm consideration,
quiet, and time, were indispensable; and the matter
<i>should</i> have his calm thoughts,&mdash;his time,&mdash;his whole
mental powers. Beyond this, the case would be one
which involved much more in a legal point of view;
for, although it might be possible to prove that Edward
L'Estrange was Viscount de Vere, and in his own right
Earl of Wentworth, by his career he had forfeited all
title to such honours.</p>

<p>He was a felon by the laws of his country,&mdash;a man
outlawed, and lying under the ban of God and his fellow-creatures.
The point at issue was this: had his marriage
been a legal one?&mdash;had he any family? For
incontestably, could this be proved, then the Earl was no
longer so; but the son or daughter of this marriage would
succeed to the title, and himself drop into Mr. de Vere.</p>

<p>Lord Wentworth was a man, and felt keenly the
degradation of such an issue&mdash;it was gall and wormwood
to him. Though by blood L'Estrange was his brother,
had he in any way merited his love? Had he not been
his rival&mdash;his bitter enemy through life? And this rival&mdash;this
enemy&mdash;was able to deprive him of his name,
his wealth, his future peace!&mdash;and all depended on
these records he held in his hand. No wonder, as he
passed across the thin bridge on his way out, and heard
the thundering torrent foaming and swirling beneath, he
felt tempted to drop the fatal budget into the wild
waters, and trust the secret to the keeping of the waves.
We are glad to say his better feelings overcame the
trial, and he bore up under a temptation, it is not too
much to say, half the world would have succumbed to.</p>

<p>"No," he thought, "I will let law take its course, it
were mean not to hear both sides."</p>

<p>The two passed the bridge, and soon afterwards arrived
at the spot where they had left their horses, when
Leonora unbound her father's eyes. The face of Nature
had changed since he was there bound two hours ago; the
moon had reached her zenith, a few only of the brighter
stars shone out, the air had gradually cooled till it was
beyond freshness, and the Earl wrapt his cloak tighter
round him.</p>

<p>Leonora blew her whistle&mdash;it was instantly answered,&mdash;a
bandit broke through the woods leading two horses:
they were not the same, but equally well bred, and
richly caparisoned.</p>

<p>After assisting Leonora to mount, the Earl was soon
firmly seated in his own saddle, and, giving a douceur to
the man, followed Leonora slowly up the steep acclivity
till they regained the road, and the scene of the morning's
assault. He was surprised to find all the bodies
had disappeared; the two poles were there&mdash;their
burdens gone! the marks of the fray were still visible,
the bodies of the disputants gone.</p>

<p>"What have they done with them?" he asked Leonora,
pointing to the spot.</p>

<p>"They have taken them to the cave," answered the
girl, "where they will be buried; it is not usually done&mdash;but
there is fear of discovery now&mdash;so they have obliterated
all marks."</p>

<p>"Leonora," said the Earl; "I can now talk freely
with you. Do you know Naples? do you ever go there?
I have my reasons for asking."</p>

<p>"I know Napoli well," replied Leonora, "and I
believe our band, at least part of it, is going to travel
thither shortly. I can go with them, they will not
suspect; but why do you ask me?"</p>

<p>"Because," said he, "though I promised not to beguile
you away&mdash;yet if you hate your present style of
life, and fly to my villa at Naples&mdash;the Villa Reale&mdash;I see
not how I shall compromise myself by offering you a
safe asylum there, or taking you to England. However,
I must have time to think it over, and I will try the
power of gold on the old man."</p>

<p>"Alas! he cares little for money."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, yet some of his band may not care so
little: my first step towards your liberation must be
getting a communication with you; I can always be
found out, you cannot; so by your coming to me only
we can fix a line of connecting link between us."</p>

<p>"I see," said Leonora; "but we should press on; it
grows late, and your friends will get alarmed."</p>

<p>"True, my child, let us hurry forward."</p>

<p>With the words he spurred his horse into breathless
speed, and side by side the two fleet animals spurned
the light sand, and after a long ride reached the myrtle
grove from whence they had started. The two dismounted,
and then came the farewell; it may seem to
some such a farewell would not be difficult, for, whatever
the relationship between the two might be, they
had in the course of their life been but slightly thrown
together: it was not the case; each dreaded the moment,
each tried to defer it, but come it must at last; and
perhaps the quicker such separations are got over the
better for those most concerned in them! It was no
common separation&mdash;no ordinary farewell: they parted
as father and child may for India, knowing they may
never see each other again, for Leonora had told the
Earl she was never more to meet him as the flower girl
of his morning excursions, and she knew not whether
she should ever be permitted to see him more; from all
they knew of Bill Stacy this was extremely likely, and
added much to the bitterness of parting. They never
did gaze again on each other's eyes&mdash;it was the last
parting here below.</p>

<p>"You are not going again to the Val," he said, still
lingering; "could you not stay to-night with us?"</p>

<p>"No, it is impossible; there are those near who would
prevent any such move! I am a slave yet; but I do
not go back; we have many lurking places nearer you
than you would believe."</p>

<p>"And I am to see you no more, my poor child,&mdash;you
are never more to greet me with flowers, and brighter
smiles, in the Val?"</p>

<p>"No more; indeed it will be long ere bright smiles
lighten my face; but though you do not see me, you
will know I love you, and if I live, I live to think of you,
and all who are dear to you and me, and when I die,
my last thought will be you!"</p>

<p>"And so will I think of you, Leonora! often and
often when&mdash;&mdash;but hark! what was that?"</p>

<p>"The signal, I must away. <i>Addio!</i> my dear father."</p>

<p>"Stay one moment, see," said the Earl, drawing forth
a ring which he placed on her finger; "if ever you want
any favour show that ring to me, or if I am gone, to any
of my family, and it will secure it for you, if it is in
their power to give it!"</p>

<p>"<i>Grazzia, grazzia tanta!</i>" said Leonora; "and here
is what will protect you and yours from every bandit in
Italy; show this, and you are safe." At the same time
she gave him the small paper with the hieroglyphic
marks that excited the Marquis' surprise some chapters
back.</p>

<p>"Farewell then, Leonora! you will always know
where to find me, and keep the ring for my sake."</p>

<p>Pressing his lips to her cheek, he commended her to
God's keeping and blessing, whilst she returned the
kiss with Italian warmth, but her heart was too full to
speak. Then breaking away she fled from him, and was
soon lost in the myrtle thicket, leaving the Earl in
mute wonder and grief.</p>

<p>In a few moments Lord Wentworth was able to collect
his thoughts; he began to think it was high time to
hurry home, and give an account of himself. The grove
was not far from the villa, and with hasty steps he
approached his dwelling, not without those feelings all
must know when, bearers of strange tidings, they draw
near to relate them to unsuspecting friends.</p>

<p>As he approached he was somewhat surprised to see
so many lights about, and still more at the groups of
wondering, whispering servants in the hall, the door of
which was wide open.</p>

<p>"God be thanked, my Lord; you are here at last!"</p>

<p>"Here, why, what&mdash;what on earth is all this&mdash;what is
the matter?"</p>

<p>"My lady is very ill," replied one.</p>

<p>"Ah, my lady is dying," said another.</p>

<p>"Ill&mdash;dying&mdash;Oh! it will drive me mad! here, out of
the way&mdash;make way there. Oh, Ellen&mdash;my wife&mdash;my
wife! I am coming!"</p>

<p>With such disjointed words did the Earl hurry to his
partner's side, where, as our readers will remember, he
had the joy of seeing her comparatively well again, and
asleep; and, after having enlightened the Marquis on
the main topics of the extraordinary affair, he retired
to rest, first depositing the papers on which so much
hung in his bureau, in the study where we first saw
him writing. Following the Earl's example we shall
also claim a short repose before again proceeding with
the story, and thus close another chapter.</p>

<p>On the morning following these events the Earl and
Countess, with the Marquis of Arranmore, deliberated
over the strange tale at their breakfast table. Lord
Wentworth had told everything to his wife during the
early watches of the morning; and if she was even more
surprised than he had been, she yet bore the trial with
still greater calmness and patience. Lord Arranmore,
perhaps of the three, seemed most affected; but their
different ideas will best be exemplified by part of the
conversation across the table.</p>

<p>"If you do wisely, Wentworth," said the Marquis,
"you will keep this story precious quiet; if it gets about
it will kick up a desperate row!&mdash;excuse the word, Countess,
but least said soonest mended; and to try the case
can do no possible good to unfortunate L'Estrange, and
will certainly do you plenty of harm."</p>

<p>"But still, Arranmore, right is right; and if I am
aware I am an usurper, I have no longer any right to
remain so."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, my dear fellow; look quietly at it. Here
is a fellow, a cut-throat, an assassin, a murderer,&mdash;and
you, without any flattery, an ornament to our peerage;
and because another old villain tells you he is your
brother,&mdash;<i>ergo</i>, my Italian cut-throat becomes an
English Earl, and my Lord of Wentworth sinks into a
plain gentleman!"</p>

<p>"You forget, he is rightful heir, and only by an adverse
fate was kept from his own. Surely, Arranmore,
if you were proved to be spending another's fortune by
misapprehension, your duty is to restore it, as well as all
you have spent."</p>

<p>"It might be my duty, but I should certainly never
stoop to it; besides, the case is different. Suppose the
cleverest lawyer in the kingdom proved to a demonstration
a convict murderer was the rightful Marquis of
Arranmore, d'you think I would give up name, title, and
possessions to him?"</p>

<p>"I did not say so; but if this convict had a son how
would it be?"</p>

<p>"You have no proof L'Estrange ever had a son. Take
my advice,&mdash;burn the papers, and never trouble your
brains about it again. I grant it maybe very romantic,
and there may be a degree of likelihood in the story;
but for romance I would never let solid reality slip away.
Think of your wife and Augusta;&mdash;as a father you are
not bound, on mere report, to bring them to ruin!"</p>

<p>"I hope," said the Countess, "as I have shared my
husband's prosperity, I shall be enabled to share his adversity,
if it is God's pleasure; and I do hope Wentworth
will be ruled by right; and whatever may happen, at
least I will not add to his trials by impatience or complainings."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure you will always be faithful for better
for worse," said the Earl, with earnestness. "No, Arranmore,
depend on it, whatever course justice points to, I
will go; and though it would be a trial&mdash;a heavy trial&mdash;to
lose rank, wealth, and authority, still the hand that gave
them takes away, and we have no right to murmur. At
least it will not be for long; but, however protracted
the trial may be, I trust I shall have grace to
bear it."</p>

<p>"That's right, dearest; I am so glad to hear you speak
thus," said the Countess.</p>

<p>The Marquis did not appear at all of the same
opinion; but with a slight toss of his head,&mdash;as much as
to say, "You're a precious fool to lose all for justice,"&mdash;asked,
"What do you mean to do first, if you are resolved
to run such an absurd course?"</p>

<p>"First," answered the Earl, "I shall leave for Naples,
and by all possible means try and find out this brother
of mine, and then frankly tell him the truth, and leave
him to decide what is to be done. The case will go
before the House of Lords, and he will, I am sure, see
the impossibility of his establishing any claim for possession;
but if he has a family, the title must descend to
them I fancy. However, the first lawyers will decide."</p>

<p>"And we shall lose our title either way, I suppose,"
said the Countess. "Poor little Augusta! I feel most for
her. It will be a dark hour; but we must try by the
sunshine within us to lighten its gloom."</p>

<p>"On my faith it is too hard! Certainly heaven
doesn't seem to favour her children; for if anybody
living should have been free from trouble, it was you,
Countess! It's hard lines, I swear; and to think it's all
in your own power. I call it a kind of tempting of Providence."</p>

<p>"You forget, Marquis, we are nowhere exempted
from the common trials mankind is heir to; at the best
we are all unprofitable servants; and as we have so long
enjoyed the beams of fortune, we are least excusable if
we faint before the first cloud. It is not I, but my husband,
that is to be most pitied,&mdash;for I merely return
to my former position in life, whilst he sinks to unaccustomed
trials! But one thing I will promise him, and
that is, he shall never know any difference in me,&mdash;except
that by fonder love I will try my best to ameliorate
his troubles."</p>

<p>"God bless you, Ellen!" said the Earl; "you have
ever been my better angel."</p>

<p>"Oh, do not say so, Wentworth; after all I only do
what it is my duty to do. Think you, when I took the
solemn vows at my marriage they were empty words? I
have loved you in health, and wealth, and happiness;
and if a few dark days have occasionally interrupted the
long career of pleasures, they have been few and far between.
Really, I am almost impatient to show you how
well I can fulfil that part of my vows which speaks of
sickness and sorrow! We have tried the better together,&mdash;perhaps,"
said the Countess, with a winning smile,
"we are to try the worse."</p>

<p>The Earl looked lovingly at his beautiful partner,
thinking he had indeed found a good thing when he
gained such a wife. The Marquis shrugged his shoulders,
as if not much liking the turn of the conversation. The
Countess arose, and left the room. When she was gone
he again addressed the Earl:</p>

<p>"I say, Wentworth, it's uncommon rum to think, if that
yarn is true, that L'Estrange was so much at his own
house without knowing it! that you and he should have
been after the same girl; and what made you the happiest
of men, made him the most miserable."</p>

<p>"It is more than strange; now that all is laid open I
sometimes wonder the idea never struck me. His age,
likeness to poor John, extraordinary early career,&mdash;so
many points of resemblance! It is hard still to fancy
him, not only my brother, but eldest brother; his associations
too with Ellen are so curious! I see it is a painful
subject to her; so I may give you the hint now to
say little about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, by Jove! for though she was free to love whom
she liked best, and was very wise to make choice of you,
there is no possible doubt but that her refusal drove
him distracted. After all, she got hold of the wrong
man!"</p>

<p>The Marquis laughed; but Lord Wentworth was apparently
little inclined for humour, and did not join in the
joke.</p>

<p>"Let's have a squint at these papers," said the former.
"I only just glanced at them last night; we shall see at
once if they are forgeries or not. I wish, i' faith, they
would turn out so, as you are determined to act like a
fool."</p>

<p>Without replying, the Earl led the way to his study.
The window was open,&mdash;the desk, unfinished letter,
everything exactly as he had left it. There was, however,
something present which excited his surprise, and
this was a large case of mahogany left on his table, and a
letter on the lid.</p>

<p>"By Saint Patrick, the Countess's jewel-box!" exclaimed
the Marquis.</p>

<p>"This grows stranger and stranger," said the Earl, as
he found his bureau burst open, and the papers gone.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you put them there?" asked the
Marquis.</p>

<p>"Sure as death! There is some vile conspiracy yet!
If they break faith with me our contract is ended; but
let us read this letter."</p>

<p>"A d&mdash;d cramped piece of penmanship,' as the
poet says," remarked Lord Arranmore; "can you read
it, Wentworth? I am not very clever at decyphering
these hieroglyphics."</p>

<p>"I will try; let us see,&mdash;it runs something like this:&mdash;'My
Lord: The jewels are turfed again, but the
papers was gave in a hurry, and are taken away. Think
no more on last night, but forget you ever ran foul of
Bill Stacy!"</p>

<p>"The villain is too clever by half," said the Marquis,
"but really I am uncommonly well pleased it has turned
out so; now you can have no possible excuse for making
a noise. Take the writer's advice if you are wise, for
whoever he be his advice is sound and good."</p>

<p>"I am really perplexed what I should do: I must go
and talk it over with the Countess; meantime we must
inform the authorities here about the savage murder
last night, but I will not let out a word about my midnight
adventure. If you will take a weed, I will go and
see Ellen, and join you again presently."</p>

<p>The Marquis, conformably to advice, lighted his
havanna and poured out a tumbler of light wine, anathematizing
the country that produced no beer, and calmly
enjoyed his "<i>otium cum dignitate</i>," whilst the Countess
and her husband were busy talking over the case, and
deciding what the next move should be. In about half
an hour the Earl again entered the study.</p>

<p>"Well, Arranmore, we are at last come to a decision:
we leave this immediately, first for Naples, and then
England. In London I shall privately obtain the best
legal advice as to the course I should pursue, and we
shall then quietly await the <i>denouement</i>. I think I
need not in any way be the prime mover, but time must
elapse before the excitement of the case is passed away,
and we are able dispassionately to consider its <i>pros</i> and
<i>cons</i>."</p>

<p>"Well, I congratulate you, my dear fellow! I for one
shall be glad to leave for the old country, for I have
paid you a long visit, and am anxious to be back at
Claremont, and see my boy&mdash;at the Easter holidays;
he is getting on capitally at Eton; I heard from him to-day."</p>

<p>"Oh did you? you generally hear pretty regularly, I
think; he is a fine fellow, and we must have him up to
Scotland in the summer. Dear me, Arranmore, if he
and Augusta took a fancy to each other what a nice
thing it would be!"</p>

<p>"Ha! I have long thought of that as a likely match;
I hope I shall live to see them married. Faith! broadlands,
and fair owners would meet. Augusta promises
to grow a rare prize, and Arthur, dear fellow, he is getting
up to me in height, though only twelve last October,"
said the Marquis, considerably overrating the young
Anak's height.</p>

<p>A week after this conversation a travelling carriage
drew up at the Villa Reale with the Earl, his wife, and
daughter, and the Marquis, who was in high spirits at
the thoughts of being homeward bound; he was to leave
on the succeeding day, the rest following in a fortnight,
as the Earl's yacht was then undergoing some slight repairs,
and would not be ready before. On the next day
Lord Arranmore left for Ireland, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Marseilles. After
seeing his friend off, the Earl called on the Count
d'Azalia, prefect of police, to inquire if the whereabouts
of Adrian Vardarelli were known, intending, if he could
gain the information, to try and obtain an interview.
Here he learned a piece of intelligence he was least prepared
for. Scarcely had he named his brother than the
Count, rubbing his hands together with joy, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah, Signore, do I know where he is? Santa Maria,
do I not! safe at last in prison!"</p>

<p>"In prison? impossible! in prison? how did you capture
him?" asked the Earl, growing very pale.</p>

<p>"He gave himself up, the rascal; he will never more
trouble the State with his atrocious villanies. He has assassinated
Luigi, his brother, and now we are only waiting
the king's pleasure, before he pays the penalty of
his crimes with his life. He will tell nothing about his
comrades, but the rack will find him a tongue. But
my Lord, you are ill, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing, a passing faintness; I'll thank you
for a glass of water."</p>

<p>The Earl drained the cooling beverage, and then
asked, "Could I see this prisoner? in what gaol is he
confined?"</p>

<p>"My Lord! see the prisoner, and why? Santa Maria,
he is in no place suited for my Lord to enter, a felon in
chains&mdash;ah! it is impossible, I fear."</p>

<p>"I have reasons for wishing to see this man, he is
connected with my family in an extraordinary way."</p>

<p>"Well, my Lord, you are too well known here to incur
suspicion, but you must be accompanied with soldiers,
and also with a padre acquainted with the English language.
There is no intention of prying into your conversation;
and any secrets, if not affecting the State, will
remain as safe with the holy man as if from the confessional.
It is a form we cannot depart from."</p>

<p>"This would be extremely unpleasant to me, Monsieur
le Comte; if I give my word of honour there is nothing
to affect the prisoner's security, could I not see
him alone? I do not doubt the honour of your priests,
but not belonging myself to the Catholic persuasion I
should be as well satisfied without one; it is in a family
matter only the prisoner is useful to me."</p>

<p>"Well, Signore, as a friend, and as a great favour, I
will give you a permit to see him for an hour or two: as
he voluntarily gave himself up there is no fear of his
trying to escape; if you will wait a few minutes I will
write a permission."</p>

<p>"Given himself up, in a dungeon heavily chained,
tortures and death in prospect, and he my brother! he
the scion of a noble race, the true possessor of lands,
title, and riches! to what has he fallen!" thought the
Earl, as he watched the Count pen the permit.</p>

<p>"I think it right to inform you," said he, as he received
the pass, "it is likely I may ask the life of this
Adrian Vardarelli; he is not what he seems, Comte, he
is not an Italian, and I have reason to believe that more
hangs on that man's life than you are aware, and possibly
the British Government may relieve you of the
charge. I say I believe it only, I am not quite certain,
but my interview with him will tell me all; meantime
there is no chance of his immediate execution is there?"</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, it would not take place for months.
There seems some mystery about this man. I have
heard before he is an Englishman."</p>

<p>"He is, and I have reason to believe he is a great
Englishman,&mdash;a man of rank and importance."</p>

<p>"Ah! that would be strange, but you will not be
able to see him till the evening; it is against usual regulations,
and must be done under the shadow of night;
and, my Lord, you will tell no one of this permit."</p>

<p>"I will not, not even my wife. To-morrow I will come
and see you again, and if he turns out what I believe
him to be, as I said, his life must be spared until the
Britannic minister has corresponded with his Majesty's
government. I wish you a good day, Monsieur le Comte,
and am much obliged for your kind services."</p>

<p>True to his promise, not even the Countess was made
a confidante; she observed there was something on her
husband's mind, and even inquired if all was right, but
seeing his desire not to be interrogated, forbore asking
more. About eight at night he told the Countess he
had an engagement, and also bade her not to be alarmed
if he was rather late in returning. Soon after he left in
a close carriage and drove to the Castel Capuano, the
ancient palace of the Swabian dynasty, now used as a
court for the different tribunals&mdash;the Court of the First
Instance, the Criminal Court, and Court of Appeal.
Beneath the palace are dark dungeons in which many a
captive has pined,&mdash;justly in requital for his crime, or unjustly,
and that often, as the victim of injured innocence.
At the palace the Earl's carriage stopped; he descended
and was met by the Count, who to his surprise led him
through the intricate passages, and then descended to
the deep vaults below. A soldier of the guard carried a
torch before them, and at last stopped before a heavily
iron-clamped door, and taking a huge bunch of keys
fitted one into the ponderous lock, and, turning it with
difficulty, next unbarred and unchained this portal of
captivity, and allowed the huge door to swing back on
its rusty hinges with a grating, harsh creak. Two
more soldiers with lanterns and muskets joined them,
and the Count and turnkey then motioned the last
mentioned to stand near the door, and the Earl also to
enter. He did so, the great gate was again closed, he
heard the bars drawn across, the chains coupled, the
massive key turn in the wards of the lock, and the footsteps
of the Count and his attendant fade away. An
involuntary shudder passed through him as he felt himself
actually within the walls of one of those dread prisons,
and in a cell that the captive's voice vainly strives to
pierce, whether innocent or guilty. One of the guards
then addressed him, warning him he had not too much
time, and had better not waste it; giving him also a
lantern, and pointing to the darkest corner of the
dungeon as the spot where the bandit lay. He received
the lantern, and walked forward to the point indicated;
by its glimmering ray he saw that the floor was uneven,
and in many places so damp it resembled a marsh. The
walls were old and mouldy, the moisture glistening on
the huge stones of which they were built; near the floor
were many bolts of mouldy iron, built into the masonry,
and from them depended rusty chains, dragging their
long length on the damp cold floor, or rather soil,
beneath his feet. As he pursued his way down the
great dungeon he came on a dread relic&mdash;a skeleton still
bound by the gyves and fetters that held it a living
prisoner long years ago. A shudder again ran through
him: who had that victim been? was it man or woman?
he was not anatomist enough to tell; had the victim
been guilty, or innocent, a noble or peasant? who should
say. He passed on; the opposing wall now appeared; in
the corner, on a bed of maize-straw, a chained prisoner
was stretched; could that be his brother? he turned the
lantern's glare on his features; he almost started back;
it was as if the Captain lay before him; never had the
resemblance seemed so striking before. The light,
blinding the captive, caused him to pass his hand over
his eyes. The Earl could see him, he could not see who
his visitor was, perhaps a messenger of death. Still the
Earl gazed on him, still he could hardly summon resolution
to speak. It was years since he had seen that face,&mdash;years
of trouble, danger, exposure, hardship; vices had
left their trace behind, they had not swept away old
likenesses. Last time he had seen that man was, when,
tiger-like, he stood over Ellen Ravensworth, and shot
the servant who saved his (the Earl's) life. And here
he lay, pale, dejected, hungry, bound, with the sentence
of death weighing on him, and his own dark thoughts
for a prison friend.</p>

<p>What a fall! what an end! The gay gallant young
soldier, the ardent lover, what had he come to? first
abductor, then murderer, escaping from prison and just
doom&mdash;not to repent, not to reform, but to sink, step by
step, to descend bar by bar, the ladder of infamy till he
was now on the very ground, a condemned felon. And
this is my brother still, and he is cold, and in prison,
and I have come to visit him, and must speak.</p>

<p>"L'Estrange," said he at last, "I grieve to find you here."</p>

<p>The convict started up to a sitting posture; his wild
eyes dilated, his hair seemed to stand, his whole frame
shook, and as he clanked his gyves together the Earl
thought he had never seen anything so dreadful, or any
picture so like Apollyon bound.</p>

<p>"Ha!" cried the wretched man; "it only wanted
this to complete the sum of misery; you are come to
glory over my fall, to reproach me for my base attempts
on Ellen, to throw my crimes in my teeth; but hear me
before God&mdash;the God I have scoffed at, and all my life
offended&mdash;I wished not to slay your brother, I knew not
what I did; and yet it was he who brought me here&mdash;he
who led me on from folly to sin, from sin to vice, from
vice to crime&mdash;he who has destroyed me soul and body.
Yes, abuse me for abusing friendship, mock at my woe,
I have deserved it well."</p>

<p>"I have not come to reproach you, nor taunt you with
crimes which, had it not been for a restraining Providence,
I might have done myself. I came to tell you I
forgive you, as I hope to be forgiven, and to see what I
can do for you, to treat you as a brother, as you are."</p>

<p>"To treat me as a brother!" said the unhappy man,
with a look of extreme surprise. "No, no, no; do
not treat me as a brother, that were worse still.
Taunt me with my crimes, I can bear it; with my
ingratitude to you,&mdash;to you who were ever a friend;
crush the viper who stung his benefactor beneath
your feet, but treat me not as a brother, I cannot
bear that; leave me to perish as I deserve."</p>

<p>"Listen, Edward L'Estrange, I speak not allegorically,
I speak plainly. I come to treat you as a brother,
because you <i>are</i> my brother; you may have striven to
hurt me, but you have really done me no harm, I have
no cause for feeling angry. I regret your unhappy life,
I mourn over your many and deep crimes, I hate the sin,
I can love the sinner: take my hand, my brother, for I
feel sure I shall prove you to be so&mdash;take it as it is
given."</p>

<p>"I cannot," replied the wretched man, "I cannot
do so; you are the first who has spoken a kind word for
years; the first who has cared for the outcast. I honour,
I love you for it, but I cannot take your hand, it would
be defilement to you, agony to me; let light and darkness
embrace first."</p>

<p>"The sinless One&mdash;our great example and guide&mdash;ever
sought sinners; take my hand, I intreat you, and forgive
me as I forgive you from my heart. I know unintentionally
I have been the prime cause of your stumbling,
let me be the first to recover you, and lead you back to
virtue. Now listen to me&mdash;I have much to say to you, and
when you have heard all you will take the hand you
still refuse; first answer me a few questions&mdash;do you
know who was your father?"</p>

<p>"I never saw him,&mdash;my birth is wrapt in mystery. I
have heard he was some great man, and I was the unrecognized
son of some one of rank in England; my early
life I have told you. One only clue, or what might be a
clue to the secret I have got, it is this." As he spoke he
drew out a small steel casket. "It is locked; when I
received it I swore never to open it till on my death bed.
I am on my death bed now but I have not yet opened
it; there is the key, you may unlock it."</p>

<p>"I will then open it," said the Earl.</p>

<p>He did so, and produced a small vellum on which the
truth was engraved in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is to certify that he who was commonly known
under the name of Edward L'Estrange was first born
son of Richard, 17th Earl of Wentworth, Arthur Plantagenet
Vere de Vere, Viscount de Vere, who was
reported to have been drowned, but was carried off by
me, William Hermiston, <i>alias</i> Mad Helder, <i>alias</i> Bill
Stacy, and brought up as a pirate till rescued by the
captain of the Arethusa, and afterwards adopted by
him and named Edward L'Estrange. That this is true
can be sworn by me, by Farmer Forbes, Jeanet Forbes,
his wife, and many others if required.
his wife, and many others if required.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 22em;">"Signed, <span class="smcap">Bill Stacy</span>."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>The Earl then handed it to the unfortunate man, who
by the dim light deciphered the writing.</p>

<p>"You will know now why I sought you,&mdash;why I called
you my brother, and why I asked your forgiveness?"</p>

<p>"Oh! this is awful news," exclaimed Viscount de
Vere, as we shall now call him, without giving him the
title he was rightful possessor of, as it would only make
confusion. "And I have been a fratricide, and all my
life waged war against my family!"</p>

<p>He covered his face with his hands, and his thoughts
were burning, intense, horrible!</p>

<p>"That miscreant Bill! If I ever saw him again&mdash;and
you think it is reliable. Ha! how often have I
heard about Arthur de Vere, and his strange loss: little
I thought it was I. And the Towers my own house,
and you all brothers and sisters, and I have made some
wretched, and slain my brother, and disgraced my race
and name! Would God I had filled that little empty
coffin I have seen in the vaults at Dun Edin Towers!
Oh! if I had been drowned. Why did I live to become
the monster of guilt I am?"</p>

<p>"It is useless to sigh over what is done; you must
try and reform and make the future redeem the past.
Yours has been a wayward fate,&mdash;born to rank and honour
which you never succeeded to, born with a mind
meant for better things, a rich soil on which not flowers,
but weeds, have luxuriated! The victim of bad men,
you have sunk to infamy; but 'though your sins be as
scarlet' recollect they may be made 'white as snow!'
the greatest sinner may yet repent!"</p>

<p>"Too late&mdash;too late." They were the only words the
hapless man could utter, so overwhelmed was he at first
by the intelligence.</p>

<p>The Earl stood silent too, then Viscount de Vere spoke:</p>

<p>"Wentworth, whatever are my rights I have forfeited
them. Will you grant my dying wish, and that is never
while I live mention this. When by my death I have
atoned for my crimes record my unhappy fate on my
tomb stone. Keep your name&mdash;use your wealth as you
ever have done, shine the star you have ever shone, and
leave your poor misguided brother to end the short time
he may yet have to live in prison."</p>

<p>"I have no right to do so if you have any family;&mdash;tell
me, had you ever son or daughter?"</p>

<p>"Never that I knew of; it is true I did marry, but
I left my wife very shortly after our union, and since
have never heard of her."</p>

<p>"At present," said the Earl, "all I can do for you is
to try and have you removed to a more comfortable
place than this damp dungeon, and supplied with bed
and proper food. I shall, I think, have influence with
the government to enable you to pass the remainder of
your life in seclusion, with every comfort that money
can bring; of course you must remain abroad, and let
me beseech you to devote your time to religion, and
seek to enjoy endless happiness above! You need not
think it is too late&mdash;greater sinners than you have found
pardon and peace; and then if your life here has been
a sad one, it will all be forgotten there!"</p>

<p>"It is useless&mdash;there is no hope for me in this world,
nor the next. There is one thing I ask, and you will
grant it I am sure; it is this, that the Countess
would come and see me. Oh! if I could only see her
once more, and know she forgave me I could die
happy."</p>

<p>"I am sure I may promise you that request. I shall
see you again to-morrow; till then adieu, for I hear
them at the door. Is there anything you would like
that I could procure?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but rest, and I am not likely to get that."</p>

<p>"Adieu, then, and God in his mercy grant the reigning
powers may give a favourable hearing to your case; at
the worst I can appeal to the House of Lords, but even
then there would be little hope."</p>

<p>The brothers then parted, and the Earl left with the
Count. In conclusion we need only say nothing could
be done for the prisoner without an interview with the
King, which the Earl solicited for the following day;
but he obtained leave for the Countess to pay a visit to
the unhappy man, and then bidding the Count good
evening, and placing a purse of gold in the guard's hand
to procure any comfort his brother might wish, he drove
home, and recounted the adventure to his wife.</p>

<p>"Will you go and see him there?" said the Earl.</p>

<p>"It will be a great trial, but I must nerve myself to it.
How impossible it seems to believe that he is your
brother and mine too!"</p>

<p>"I shall crave an audience of the King to-morrow
after leaving you there, and whilst I am away you can
converse with him. If I procure his freedom we must
try and get a residence either in Sicily, or some of the
neighbouring islands, where he can lead a retired life,
and occasionally see his friends. There is one thing
sure, and that is his life is now a short one,&mdash;he has
already reached an age few De Veres ever attained, but
I only hope your influence may yet do something to
lead his mind to better things. I wish I could have
seen in him repentance rather than remorse for his life
of crimes."</p>

</div></div>


<p>We return to Viscount de Vere. When the Earl had
left him, the guards had departed, the door been bolted
and barred, and lights fled, he felt indeed alone. The
dungeon in which he was confined was cold and dark,
but scarcely so cold as the past seemed to him, and
scarcely so dark as the future. Seldom, perhaps, has such
an adverse fate ever followed mortal,&mdash;seldom has one
seen an instance in which one who might have graced the
rank to which he was born, has been, as it were, crushed
to be a disgrace! We can afford to look harshly on the
character of Captain de Vere; but pity must mingle with
our frown when we look fairly on his victim. In the
expressive words of the poet we have before quoted,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His heart was formed for softness&mdash;warped to wrong."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He had no right to become what he did. Had he had
ordinary advantages, he might have lived to be an ornament
to his profession, and an example instead of a
beacon to warn others from the shoals on which he had
wrecked his bark. We have only to glance over a few
of the turning points in his life to see this. An innocent
child,&mdash;not for his own fault but his father's,&mdash;is carried
off by a wronged and desperate man. Had this not
occurred, in all probability he would have grown up in
his right position, and this tale would never have been
written. This child, bred as a young pirate, nurtured
among the wildest scenes of vice and bloodshed, was by
a happy incident, rescued from this odious life; and had
the action that delivered him destroyed his evil angel,
Stacy, he would have still, in all likelihood, reflected
honour on his rescuer. In the changes of life this young
man and his destroyer are again thrown together, and an
evil acquaintance begun. His greatest friend is cut off
by yellow fever, and bearer of his sword, he makes his
first acquaintance with her, his wild passion for whom
sealed his woe. Once more he is thrown amongst his
own family as a stranger, and as a guest enters his paternal
hall.</p>

<p>His brother, in a high position at his expense, sues
for and obtains the love of his adored one. No marvel
the fiend of jealousy burned within him. He seeks
Stacy as a counsellor, and by another strange mischance,
meets his brother the Captain. From that fatal night
we may date the first move downwards; like the train
on the incline he began slowly,&mdash;his descent became
swifter and swifter,&mdash;till at last, unable to arrest his dread
pace, with fearful rapidity he rushed down the steep of
sin and misery to the gulf of everlasting woe! He tried,
first by deception, then by passionate entreaty, to regain
the heart he had lost. Then came the second lost opportunity,&mdash;the
night at the Towers, when a little firmness
would have stayed his decline. He was of a wavering
mind, an unfixed will, and the stern, strong-minded Captain
outflanked him, and the second stage of infamy began.</p>

<p>We need not recapitulate the abduction of Ellen Ravensworth,
the relief, his rescue from prison, subsequent
disgraceful life, and attempted outrage on his old flame.
Attachment had lost its pureness, all its hallowed
light was shadowed, dimmed, departed; yet who could
read of the last wrest from his native land, or see the
hopeless passion in his black heart, when he felt himself
wrung away from love and virtue, yet hating the life of
crime he was drifting to, without feeling pity for the lost,
erring man against whom the stars seemed to fight in
their courses! After that fatal night the scene grows
darker; we pass over the slave dealer and bloodthirsty
brigand; the fearful quarrel, where brother mixed with
brother in mortal fray; the escape, and the surrender;
and we are now gazing on the actor of so many dreadful
scenes lying a chained convict in a Neapolitan gaol.</p>

<p>We last saw him flying with his blood-won prize;&mdash;what
has become of her&mdash;of Caroline Lennox? Often in a heart
black as night there lingers something human,&mdash;something
which, if it be not virtue, is so like it that it is
attractive the more so for being alone amid a host of
evil passions,&mdash;an Abdiel among innumerable false ones!
Such a glimpse of better days shone in Adrian's mind,
when he first resolved to save Caroline, and for her sake
perpetrated the dark crime. At the first town he
arrived at, Ariano, he left the young lady at the inn,
giving also full directions that everything should be
placed at her command which money could buy; for this
he gave the host a purse of gold, at the same time threatening
him with Adrian Vardarelli's vengeance if he failed
to give an account of it. That name was sufficient to instil
terror into the man's heart; and Caroline lacked no
good thing till she was rescued from her sad position and
sent to Scotland. Here (at Ariano) we leave her for
the present, and follow Adrian, who, by forced marches,
reached Naples, and at once gave himself up to the
authorities; he was flung into the gaol where we found
him, loaded with chains, till the merciful authorities
chose to end his sufferings by beheadal or hanging.</p>

<p>He was a man then more sinned against than sinning,&mdash;led
by worse advisers to perpetrate deeds which, left
to himself, he would never even have thought of.
Since the Earl's visit to him, and the discovery of his
real position, his mind had grown darker and darker;
so miserable did he become that death would have been
a friend! It had been better he had never known it.
One thing alone shed a ray, not of hope, but comfort in
his night of sorrow: this was the thought he should ere
long see her for whom he still entertained the liveliest
affection. Strange it should have been so!&mdash;she whose
broken plight had brought him to his present low estate,
was yet dearer than all else; she was the only being
he yet desired to live for. He felt he must have forfeited
her love, her regard,&mdash;but not her pity. To hear
her say, "I forgive;" to press the hand he had once
pressed, when sincere and faithful; to hear the voice
he loved and had heard in better hours; this would be
the last joy he should rejoice in; and then, having bid
farewell to her, having feasted his eyes once more, welcome
darkness, welcome death! He was roused from
such thoughts by the re-entrance of his keeper; this
was unusual, and he began to wonder what it might
mean. It was the Earl's gratuity to his guard which
occasioned the surprise; in his eyes his prisoner was now
a very different person; one who enjoyed the protection
of the great English lord was very different from the
friendless captive; and anxious to make reparation for
the past, the Italian soldier, Giacomo, was bearer of a
good repast, whilst two other men brought a mattress,
on which the outlaw might lie more comfortably,
as well as a sheepskin to cover him.</p>

<p>"Is there anything else Signore would like?" asked
the guard of his astonished prisoner.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Viscount de Vere. He then whispered
something in the man's ear; a gesture told him he understood
his meaning. The man then unbound his hands
and feet, left a lantern and his supper, saying he would
bring what he asked for early next day, and consigned
him once more to solitude and his dark thoughts.</p>

<p>When the doors were barred the unhappy man rose,
stretched his limbs, ate a few morsels of bread, drank a
deep draught of spirits, and then began to pace his cell,
backwards and forwards, as long as the light befriended
him. Ere long the lamp began to flicker, the wick was
burned to the socket, and it lit up, and darkened the
prison with spasmodic convulsions, till it went out and
left him in total darkness. Groping his way to the
miserable bed, he stretched himself on it, drew the sheepskin
over him, and actually slept.</p>

<p>He was awoke by the noise of the door being unbolted;
soon afterwards Giacomo appeared with his breakfast,&mdash;the
first one he had seen,&mdash;thanks to the purse! he also
received from his keeper a small parcel, from which he
tore the paper, and produced a glass phial full of a liquid
as clear as water; he drew the cork, placed the bottle
beneath his nose, and then, as if satisfied it was what
he wanted, recorked it, and hid it under his vest.</p>

<p>"An English donna is going to visit Signore," said
Giacomo.</p>

<p>"At what hour?"</p>

<p>"Afternoon, I think."</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" exclaimed Viscount de Vere, clasping
his hands together. "Leave me now;&mdash;no,&mdash;stay,&mdash;bring
paper, pen, and ink."</p>

<p>In a short time these were brought, and the Viscount
began to write. Several times he tore up what he had
written; at last, as if satisfied with the contents, he
folded the sheet, and addressed it to&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>The Right Honourable, the Countess of Wentworth.</i>"
He also placed it beneath his vest. He then walked
again hurriedly up and down his cell, often marking a
ray of sunshine which crept along the damp ground&mdash;this
was his timepiece. So accurately had he noticed its
travels, he seemed to know the very minutes of its onward
march. Hours rolled on. The beam had reached
the allotted distance. "'Tis noon," he involuntarily exclaimed,
drawing a long, deep sigh.</p>

<p>A few minutes, and he heard a footstep approaching
the door, the key grated in the wards&mdash;he shuddered, and
staggering rather than walking to his couch, threw himself
on his breast, and buried his face in his hands. He heard
the door open, and soon afterwards a light step approaching
him&mdash;it ceased&mdash;she stood beside him. With a
sudden exertion he sprung up and threw himself on his
knees; for a few seconds he dared not look up; at last
he raised his eyes&mdash;yes, there she stood, the lady of his
love; long years had passed since he last saw her, but
she was the same Ellen, her beauty matured, but unimpaired;
she stood like his good angel, weeping over
her lost charge; tear after tear gathered and fell from
those large, blue eyes. This was his third strange interview
with the adored idol of his heart. Once he had
kneeled at her feet and from those lips heard the fatal
words that sealed his doom; once he had stood the brutal
oppressor over the weeping suppliant; now he kneeled at
her feet, the convict prisoner; each had been a darker
shade. On former occasions twice had Ellen opened the
conversation, this time she was unable to speak, and it
devolved on him to break silence.</p>

<p>"Ellen," he said, "unworthy as I feel to take your
pure name on my defiled lips, do you forgive me? Oh!
say so, and I die happy."</p>

<p>"Edward, I have nothing to forgive; I have forgiven
long ago; it is I who should ask forgiveness of you."</p>

<p>"Thanks, lady, I can now die happy."</p>

<p>"Ah, Edward&mdash;for so I must still call you&mdash;to die
happy there is need of forgiveness of sins; but why do
you talk of death? I do hope and believe Wentworth
will be able to procure your freedom, and then let your
remaining years try and make up for the past, of which
we will speak no more."</p>

<p>"No. I shall never leave this dungeon: it is too late
now. Mine has been a wayward fate, it will soon be
over. I have been too black a criminal; I have long
bade adieu to hope."</p>

<p>"Ah! say not so: you little know the power of grace.
Sinners greater far than you have been washed and made
clean; why should you despair?"</p>

<p>"Ellen, it is useless to speak thus; I tell you I am
lost, eternally lost. Had my life been different, had you
been what you might have been to me, it would have
been far otherwise; but regrets are useless, you have
come too late to save me from the reward of my crimes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Edward! I know I have been deeply to blame,
I know it was my change of sentiments to you that
worked your ruin; to my dying hour I shall never cease
to mourn over my fault. Oh, if I was the first to lead
you astray, let me be the first to guide you back, and if
in this world we have been severed, in that which is to
come we shall meet to part never more. I speak as
a sister now, as I am; dear brother, say not it is too
late."</p>

<p>"Ellen, do not blame yourself thus. How was it
possible you should love me? your heart was free, and
because denied to me, I strove by mad violence to regain
it, and lost all, deservedly."</p>

<p>"But you have it now, not as it was, but in a new
light, a sister's love; and as a sister I have mourned
over you; and often, often have I remembered in my
prayers my erring friend. Oh! let them be granted by
my seeing you put away the old man and be renewed in
spirit."</p>

<p>"Alas! it is all to no purpose. I am lost, lost."</p>

<p>"You mistake the Gospel, it saves to the <i>uttermost</i>;
the veriest outcast can find peace, for every sin there is
forgiveness."</p>

<p>"Save one&mdash;you forget the verse, 'There is a sin unto
death.'"</p>

<p>"But we know not what that is, and while life lasts
the greatest sinner may return; the prayer of the
dying thief was heard, so will yours be heard and
answered."</p>

<p>"Vain, vain, I tell you, Ellen; I cannot pray; the
Spirit left me long ago. I know the very night&mdash;the very
hour&mdash;he left; that night I sold myself to the devil, the
night I agreed to the diabolic plot against you, Ellen.
Since then I have never felt aught save remorse, no desire
to be better; prayer has frozen on my lips, I am a reprobate."</p>

<p>"You think too darkly. Oh! try and pray with me;
resist the evil spirit, and he will flee from you."</p>

<p>The Countess knelt down beside the wretched man, and
offered up a fervent prayer to heaven for him. He heard it
with a cold, gloomy expression, and when she ceased, only
said, "I cannot say amen; I tried, but it is impossible;
believe me, Ellen, I am lost,&mdash;and, what is more, I mourn
not my lost heaven. I want not paradise, but rest.
Could I rest for ever in the dark grave 'twill be enough.
I have seen you, I have heard you forgive me; the voice
I loved in better days to hear has thrilled through me;
I have had all I want, leave me to finish life as I deserve.
Why should you or my brother trouble yourselves
more?"</p>

<p>Tears of sorrow again coursed the Countess's cheek, as
she bent over her old lover, and, taking his hand, said,
"Do you love me, Edward?"</p>

<p>"Love you? yes; beyond all things earthly and
divine. Ellen, you are the only being I love," answered
the Viscount, with wild emotion.</p>

<p>"Then, if you love me, you will try and prepare for
that place where I humbly hope&mdash;nay, believe&mdash;after
death I shall live; you would not wish to be parted both
in time and in eternity?"</p>

<p>"Ellen, you ask an impossibility. Ask anything else.
No, it is not my wish, but so it must be. In this life I
have seen you afar off, in the life that is to come I must
see you afar off too. Oh! that we had never met. Do
you recollect what I said when on my knees, which were
never bent to man or to God since that moment? did I
not say your refusal would drive me to desperation? see
what it has done. I do not blame you; I have myself
to blame: but ours was an ill-starred acquaintance&mdash;an
ill-starred love. No, no, you will mourn for me here;
you will sometimes give a passing thought to one who
adored you so, for never was needle truer to the north
than in weal and woe my heart has been to you. This is
all I ask; and for me, I am not worthy to love you,&mdash;you
are like a star I may look up to and worship, but which
is at once shrined far above my affection or my hate."</p>

<p>For a long while after the Viscount ceased no word
was uttered by either. The scene was at once a striking
and a sad one. The prisoner had sunk back on his side, and,
resting on his left elbow, gazed on the lovely being who
knelt beside him with her hands clasped, and her eyes
turned heavenwards. Her lips moved as though she
were breathing a fervent petition for her brother. How
marked was the contrast between the expression of those
two!&mdash;vice had sullied the handsome features of one;
virtue had lent a purer radiance to the sweet face of
the other. How strange the contrast of their hearts!&mdash;one
like the glacier, cold, dead, unmelting; the other
like the warm sunbeam, which, alas! throws its brightness,
but thaws not the icy mass it shines on. How different
were their thoughts!&mdash;one was thinking with remorse on
his wretched past life, without hope of a future; the
other, whilst mourning over the falsehood which had
worked such a ruin, was still ardent with hope that in
due time her prayers would be answered; and as the
mastless, rudderless vessel, tossed and well nigh wrecked
on the tumultuous billows, can yet be refitted, and with
a wise captain and pilot steer her way to the haven she
was bound for, so would this erring man forget, in that
plenitude of rest, peace, and happiness, the storms and
tempests, shoals and rocks, of the voyages that had
brought him thither.</p>

<p>This silence might have lasted still longer had not the
entrance of Giacomo broken it.</p>

<p>"My lady," said he, "Milord wishes to see you; would
you follow me?"</p>

<p>The Countess rose. "Adieu, then, for the present, Edward;
I shall pray for you, and you will show your love
to me by thinking more calmly. I will come and see
you again soon, and I hope in another place than this."</p>

<p>She held her hand out with a mournful smile; the
Viscount seized it and pressed it to his lips, his heart was
too full to allow him to frame the word "adieu." The
lady turned away; he watched her till the dark door
shut her out from his view, then, sitting up, took the
small phial from his breast, laid the letter on the bed
beside him, drew the cork, and tossed it from him. "I
have nothing more to live for since I have seen her;
there is no spot on earth I could live at, and feel she was
another's wife," thought the hapless man. "Farewell,
Ellen! a long farewell."</p>

<p>He then emptied the contents of the bottle over his
throat: it was prussic acid, and with fearful rapidity did
its fatal work! he felt the hand of death on him whilst
he was even swallowing it, sank back, uttered a faint cry
of distress, and ceased to live, in less than a minute after
swallowing the dreadful draught! So died he, poor
erring man! So died he who should have been a peer
of England, and yet ended his life a prisoned brigand,
a suicide!</p>

<p>When the Earl sent for the Countess it was to inform
her that he had procured the necessary pardon for his
brother.</p>

<p>"He is in an unhappy state of mind," said the Countess,
"but I have hopes that the very fear of unworthiness
he has is the first fruits of repentance, and the foretaste
of better thoughts."</p>

<p>"God grant it may be so," said the Earl; "but now
let us go and tell him the good tidings; it will doubtless
have a favourable effect on him, for freedom engenders
far better thoughts than captivity."</p>

<p>Together they sought the gaol once more, eager to
bear the glad tidings. When they entered, the Countess
hastened forward: the fixed features, the glassy eye and
clenched hands, the empty phial beside him, told the
dread truth, and with a cry of terror, she sank in a dead
swoon at the side of the hapless victim. The Earl, terrified
at the dangerous effect it might produce on his wife,
and shocked at the catastrophe, called for assistance,
himself bore the senseless lady from the terrible scene,
and attended to her first. It was long ere she recovered
the dreadful shock she had sustained, and even when
her consciousness returned she wept in such an hysterical
manner, as to alarm her husband not a little. When
she reached the villa she became calmer, but it was
many days ere she again left her room.</p>

<p>The Earl, after seeing his wife in safety, returned to
the prison, and long gazed in silence on the remains of
the wretched suicide: he found too the letter addressed
to the Countess; it was a very sad one.</p>

</p>
<p>"When you read this I shall have ceased to breathe:
life has to me been a weary load, and I am glad
to shake it off. It might have been far different, and
'tis the thought of what might have been makes the
present hour so bitter. You might have been mine, and
I might have been great, and good! but what matters
what might have been, I have to do with what <i>is</i>. No
joy to look back on, no heaven to look forward to, I am
a heartbroken man. I have been the dupe of others,&mdash;my
crimes have been my misfortune rather than fault. I
have no redeeming trait save love to you; can the guilty
love the guiltless&mdash;the vile love the pure? my passion
answers all, 'I loved the right, the wrong pursued.' I
have been a bane to my family, I might have been a
blessing! You forgive me, Ellen: it is all I want!
Forget such a one as I ever lived. I ask the tribute of
one tear at my sad fate; you will not deny my last request.
Oh! Ellen, it gives the sting to death, this separation
from you, but it must be so. Farewell!</p>

<p>"Sometimes in quiet hours think of his luckless fate,

<p>"P.S. This is the first, and will be the last time I
ever signed my real name. Ask my brother, to whom
I have been so unworthy a brother, to see that my remains
are decently interred. Tell my story on my
tombstone, then bury me out of sight and out of mind.
This last act of my wretched career may be the worst,
life has lost its charm&mdash;pardon me the pain this crime
may give you."</p></div>

<p>When the Earl read this letter to his wife it was with
bitter grief she heard his last, worst deed&mdash;and we need
not say she often thought of that misguided man, shed
not one but many, many a tear, and thus fulfilled his
last petition. Ah, what an end had her young lover
come to!</p>

<p>The remains of Viscount de Vere were interred in the
grounds of the Villa Reale, and over his tomb rose a
marble fane with the following inscription&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">Here lies<br />
<span class="smcap">Arthur Plantagenet Vere De Vere</span>&mdash;<br />

<p>A few days after the funeral, which took place at the
dead hour of midnight, the Earl and Countess with their
daughter left Naples by their yacht, and sailed for
Leith, where they arrived safely after a long and stormy
passage. They then started for the Towers, where they
lived in deep seclusion.</p>

<p>Mr. Scroop had meanwhile started for Italy to bring
home the unfortunate daughter of his murdered father-in-law,
and make arrangements with the authorities for
bringing his murderers to justice, a point, however, in
which they entirely failed to succeed.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lovely in life, and unparted in death."&mdash;<i>Anon.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>About two months after their arrival at the Towers,
the Earl and Countess in the garb of deep mourning
were walking together down the Holly Walk. We do not
know why they chose that peculiar place, fraught with
so many sad recollections; however, they silently trod the
verdant path, and seated themselves on the selfsame bench
where young Ravensworth had last sat, where Lady
Florence and Ellen rested on the morning of his departure.</p>

<p>"Ellen," said the Earl, "we have now been united for
twelve years, and never has one unkind word or action
marred my domestic bliss; you have been my partner
in joy, my solace in woe, and as our family tree is stript
leaf by leaf, and we two, and our bud Augusta are alone
left, I often think what should I do without you."</p>

<p>"My dearest Wentworth, I have often told you it is
but my duty&mdash;a delightful one&mdash;to try and be a helpmate
instead of hindrance to you; and I may say too during
all our married life I have never seen an unkind look,&mdash;you
have been my love and faithful lover in a way unhappily
too rare."</p>

<p>"Yes, we were made for each other, Ellen; they say
marriages are made in heaven: I am sure ours was, for
by my union with you I have won everything in this
world and the next. I have lived to see and admire
your silent example, lived to see its blessed fruits in my
two sisters, lived to follow and value religion, and to
feel the assurance that our hearts are bound not only
now, but to all eternity in cords of everlasting love."</p>

<p>"Give to God the praise, dearest Wentworth; if I
have been the unworthy instrument of leading you from
earthly dross to eternal and unchangeable riches, I have
been <i>only</i> the poor instrument, but this seems my happiness;
to hear my best loved speak so is the bright
answer of many, many prayers. I knew they would be
answered. I felt sure you were mine both upon earth
and in heaven!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Ellen, it is in this one sees the reality of religion.
What are rank, earthly honours, position, wealth, if
only to be used or abused here? What are all to a
dying man? Yes, it is one thing to talk of death, one
thing to enjoy life, as if death existed not,&mdash;it is another
to know our end is near, to feel we must soon lose all;
leave the world naked as we came into it, tread out
on empty space, quit our firm footing below! had we
then no assurance that around us were the everlasting
arms, what would all earthly joys do for us? but thanks
to heaven, and to you for leading me to seek that treasure
where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, I feel
that if called to die this night I could die happy. There
might be the pang mortal man must own when his breath
forsakes him, there might be the human dread of the
cold tomb, the pain of the wrench from those we love
below, but my mind would be happy, happy in the
thought I should soon see you again, and those I loved,
and have darkly lost."</p>

<p>"True, dearest, and earth has so little left us now, it
seems as if we were called to think more on heaven!
Every tie seems severed but one&mdash;our daughter. I
would endure to live for her and for you, but certainly
most of our dear ones are beyond the grave, and there
my heart often soars too."</p>

<p>"I have a strange presentiment, dearest Ellen, that I
shall not long be spared to you. Since my brother's
death I have felt the shadow of the tomb overshading
me! Whether it was the awful scene of his self-destruction,
or the air of the damp dungeon in which
he was confined, I know not, but I have never felt the
same man since. I think I shall soon go too!"</p>

<p>"Ah! say not so," said the Countess. "Oh, Wentworth!
you must not leave us. It is a different thing
to speak of death and to see our dearest fade beneath
its cruel breath! You must take advice, dear, and
change the air. This uncertain climate, after so long a
residence in Italy, is not suiting you. Promise me you
will take advice."</p>

<p>"It is needless, love; no doctor could avail. Remember
the Weird; remember what I told you in the grot
where I sought and won your hand and heart. Ours is a
strange family! Coming death with us casts his shadow
ever before. I have long been under that shade. No,
Ellen, it is come at last; I shall never see the summer
roses! Spring is now putting out her buds and early
leaves, but summer's flowers will blossom over my
tomb."</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear husband," said the Countess, with tears
in her eyes, "do not talk thus, and break my heart.
Oh! live for your Ellen! it will kill her if you die. Live
for Augusta! Oh, do not&mdash;do not leave us."</p>

<p>"I hear the voice that calls me, Ellen; you must not
weep so; it will only be for a little while we are separated;
it is but a <i>narrow</i> stream, and you will live and
bring up our pledge of fondest love, little Augusta; let
her be your second self, and I will look down on you,
and be very near you still, only the thinnest, airiest
veil will lie between us. I believe, and I think many
believe with me, our departed friends are close beside
us. I doubt not Edith and Florence are very near now;
we cannot see, nor feel, nor hear them, but 'tis only the
breaking of life's silver cord that severs us."</p>

<p>"Wentworth, if you die your Ellen will not long survive
you. Do you recollect too what I told you when
we pledged our faith? that not even death should part
us&mdash;it will not, I feel sure. But here comes Augusta with
early flowers, dear child; let us speak of happier things.
Come, darling, you must banish these thoughts of gloom;
you will be spared long to us both, I am sure."</p>

<p>The Earl shook his head, and rose to greet his little
daughter, who had made a bouquet of sweet primroses,
violets, and snowdrops, gathered by the burn's side, for
her mother. The Countess received the offering with a
smile, kissed her daughter, and the family group then
returned to the Towers, conversing on ordinary topics.
Still through the remainder of the day a cloud often
darkened over the Countess's face as she thought on the
morning's conversation; and her husband's words, alas!
too prophetic in their doom, rung like a death-knell in
her ears.</p>

<p>She could not help noticing a peculiar and unusual
heaviness about the Earl; he was not like himself all
day, and retired to rest at an early hour. Lady Wentworth's
fears were, however, partially chased away by
the good spirits in which her husband rose next morning.
He asked her to accompany him on horseback,
with Augusta, to some of the surrounding farms, which
she gladly acceded to. They returned at luncheon
time, and shortly after that meal her anxiety was first
awakened by a rather alarming giddiness and faintness
which suddenly attacked the Earl. It was some
time ere he recovered his sensibility, and then a severe
headache oppressed him, growing so bad that before
evening the Countess prevailed on him to allow her to
send for the physician. The latter at once perceived
it was from fever that he was suffering, and ordered
him to bed. For some days no bad symptoms were
observed; the doctor was quite sanguine, and told
the Countess that he doubted not but that the unimpaired
physical strength of the Earl would get the better
of the disease. About the eighth day, however, unfavourable
symptoms first showed themselves, and the
fever assumed the low typhoid form. Another medical
adviser was called in. From the first, however, the
Earl had told the doctor he should not recover; but
this was kept from the Countess, who hoped on still.
The fell disease ran on its course, every day the fever
became fiercer, and at last even Ellen saw there was
little hope of his recovery. The fever did its work of
ruin with ruthless vengeance, prostrating its victim, and
undermining his strength, till the stout Earl was reduced
to the mere shadow of what he had been. From the
eighteenth day more or less delirium and stupor set in,
and he knew no one, not even Ellen, who with unremitting
care had watched him through his illness, and
never once left his side, scarcely closing her eyes.</p>

<p>The crisis arrived: for twenty-one days he had been
stretched on the bed of sickness,&mdash;for nearly four delirium
triumphed. About noon he opened his eyes, and
when he saw his pale loving wife sitting by him holding
his hot dry hand in her own, and chafing his temples, he
smiled and articulated the word "Ellen." She eagerly
drunk the sound&mdash;it was life in death to her.</p>

<p>"You know me then, dearest, you are better?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you now, my love. I feel better, but I
am very weak. Go and take some sleep, dearest, I shall
be better soon."</p>

<p>Exhausted with the exertion of speaking so long, he
sank back on his pillow. Ellen kissed his brow softly,
and whispering, "I shall soon be back, darling," left
him to seek Nature's great restorer, of which the gentle
lady had so much need. She never saw him again;
she never more came back to sit at his loved side. The
fatigue of twenty-one days' watch, twenty-one nights'
sleepless vigil, was too much even for her system. Her
head ached throbbingly, she could not sleep, so hot and
fevered she grew; and when trying to wrestle with
tired Nature's demands, she again rose to continue her
labour of love, she sank exhausted on the ground. She
was placed on a sofa and restoratives employed, but without
effect, and about the hour of sunset the doctor pronounced
life fled! The Earl recovered from the fever,
but not from its effects. He never rose from the bed on
which he had so long lain, but during the five days he
still survived he was blessed with the full possession of
his reason. He missed his kind attentive wife, and
often asked after her. Fearing the effects of his learning
the sad news, the doctors for some time deceived
him so far as to tell him she was only ill, very ill, or
would be beside him.</p>

<p>"Why is she not brought here?" he asked. He read
the answer in the face of his attendants. "Tell me the
whole truth, hide nothing from me&mdash;Ellen is no more."</p>

<p>"She is in heaven,&mdash;she is happy. My daughter is
safe now beyond the storms of life," said Mr. Ravensworth,
who stood beside his couch.</p>

<p>"She has been faithful to death," said the dying
man, "and has received her crown of life before me. I
can die calmer now. I shall see her again very soon.
Call my daughter, Augusta; I must bid her adieu.
Has the Marquis arrived yet?"</p>

<p>"He is expected every moment," said Mr. Ravensworth.
"Mr. Power is also here. Would you like to
receive the Sacrament?"</p>

<p>"Yes, much&mdash;very much. You will share it with me,
will you not?"</p>

<p>"I will. Shall I call Mr. Power, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, now,&mdash;and Augusta."</p>

<p>The dying man sank back, and closed his eyes,&mdash;he
seemed lost in prayer,&mdash;so much so he did not notice
either Augusta, the clergyman, nor the Marquis, who
had just arrived by express speed, and stood by his
friend's bed with clasped hands, and eyes wet with tears.
The Earl opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Call Andrew and Philip. I feel death's hand upon
me now. I must take leave of my faithful servants."</p>

<p>Some one left the room quietly; and soon afterwards
the <i>leal</i> old butler, and Philip, as well as several
other servants, amongst whom came Wilton, entered the
chamber of death.</p>

<p>It was the hour when early dawn first glows the orient
skies. That rising sun would be the last that would
ever lighten the Earl's eyes! It was a lovely morning
in late spring,&mdash;a dewy coolness breathed over the
woods and plains,&mdash;the first rays were shedding their
radiance on the distant hills,&mdash;the old Towers were
just catching the descending glory,&mdash;birds were singing,
flowers unfolding, and timid deer shaking the dew-drops
from their flanks. It was the infancy of the
day,&mdash;the birth of the light,&mdash;the morning of the
natural world,&mdash;the spring of the year. It was all this
without. To have walked over the verdant park,&mdash;to
have wandered through the green woods, with their
vernal leaf,&mdash;to have tracked the bubbling rivulet,&mdash;to
have breathed the fresh morning air,&mdash;to have watched
the matin glow,&mdash;to have heard the bird's early carol,&mdash;to
have glanced at that fine old mansion,&mdash;who
would have thought of death? Everything was life!
Everything was gladness without those walls! Who
would have thought of death within? And yet the
owner of these broad estates,&mdash;these woods,&mdash;flood and
fells,&mdash;the lord of that ancient castle,&mdash;the master of all
we see,&mdash;was then <i>dying</i>. The lady of his love,&mdash;the
mistress of all we see,&mdash;<i>dead</i>!<a name="FNanchor_I_" id="FNanchor_I_"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_" title="See Note N. Deaths of Earl and Countess." class="fnanchor">[I]</a> Ah! what a different
scene is within that pile! Let us open the door of the
banqueting-room&mdash;the room where wine and merriment
had often made the long winter evenings seem
short&mdash;the room where we have seen so many of the
noble family and their friends pass the wine-cup that
circled the halls with glee! Let us see what is there
now. The great table is clothed with crape; the walls
are draped with black; and on that table lies a narrow
coffin. There is nothing funeral about its appearance;
it is covered with white velvet, and ornamented with
silver; white silken ropes pass through the handles, and
each has a wrought-silver tassel. A bright silver plate
shines in the centre,&mdash;above it the coronet and arms of
the Wentworths are engraved,&mdash;on it are the simple
name and age of the departed one,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ellen, Countess of Wentworth</span>,<br />
Aged 31 years.<br />
She sleeps in peace!</p>

<p>On the lid a wreath of white roses has been placed, as
a tribute of undying love, by Augusta. There is something
bright in the death of such a being,&mdash;it is the
birth into glory!</p>

<p>Let us next ascend the staircase, and, passing along
the corridor, open the door of the Earl's room. Here
another sad sight awaits us. On his dying bed, supported
by pillows, he sits up, his two hands placed on
Augusta's fair hair; she kneels beside her expiring
parent, and weeps with wild despair. A beautiful girl
of eleven, she is early called to suffer bereavement!
Her mother lies cold below,&mdash;her father lies sinking
before her. No marvel the poor child weeps! She is
losing a fond father,&mdash;has lost a fond mother. Beside
her stands the tall, stalwart Marquis of Arranmore.
His face is buried in his hands. He is losing a dear
friend and brother! At the foot of the couch kneels the
clergyman, at the side of Mr. Ravensworth, offering a
prayer to heaven to support and comfort in the hour of
death, and look with pity on the orphan. He is losing
a kind patron. Near the door are grouped the weeping
servants. They are losing a generous master. There is
one other occupant of the chamber,&mdash;the Earl's Newfoundland
dog. That dumb animal knows well his lord
is dying, and with wistful glance watches his every
movement. On a small table beside the bed are the
sacred Elements, about to be administered. All are
silent. Nought is heard save the subdued weeping of
men, and the unrestrained sobs of the only representative
of woman, poor little Augusta. That still silence
is broken. Who speaks? The dying man. Every
ear is attentive,&mdash;every heart responsive as he speaks!</p>

<p>"Andrew, you have ever been a faithful servant to
me; when I am gone, for my sake, be a faithful servant&mdash;nay
friend&mdash;to my child!"</p>

<p>"Gude bless you! I will&mdash;I will!" cried the poor old
man. "But, oh! it is a sair trial to lose you, my good
master!"</p>

<p>"I say the same to you, Philip, and the rest. Adieu
to you all."</p>

<p>The Earl ceased. Again the voice of weeping was
heard. Poor old Andrew came forward and pressed his
master's hand to his lips, then retired, whispering the
rest to follow him, leaving only the family in the room.</p>

<p>"And now, my little Augusta, your papa is dying,
love! You will be an orphan, my child; but the God
of the fatherless will be your God! Promise me,
darling, to seek early that friend,&mdash;the only friend on
the bed of death. Kiss me, love. And I am sure your
uncle will be a kind uncle to you when your papa is no
more. Farewell, my little Augusta, God bless and keep
you!"</p>

<p>Another pause:&mdash;then, addressing the Marquis, he
continued: "You will be a father to my child when
she is left an orphan. Oh! bring her up so that she
may resemble her sainted mother. And you, my dear
Ravensworth, you, too, will remember my daughter's
spiritual welfare. You are her Godfather. Oh! act
up to your sacred office! I should like to see you
alone, Arranmore, now,&mdash;only a few moments, and then
I will receive the Communion."</p>

<p>At the hint Mr. Ravensworth led Augusta from the
room to an ante-chamber, whither he and Mr. Power
also retired.</p>

<p>The Earl then said, "My dear Arranmore, I wished
to see you privately about the possibility of there being
yet a claimant to my title. Should such a one come
forward, promise me, as a friend and brother, you will
abide by justice. Not even for Augusta, to whom I
commend your fondest love, depart from the right, or
swerve from truth. You will promise me?"</p>

<p>"I will," said the Marquis, scarcely articulating the
word in his grief.</p>

<p>"And you will be Augusta's guardian and guide.
You and Ravensworth I have made co-trustees and
guardians. Oh! bring her up to emulate her dear
mother,&mdash;this is my dying wish,&mdash;let it be sacred! I
should of all things like the union of our families in
Augusta and your Arthur, but only if they love each
other. You will bury me side by side with Ellen. And
that is all. You may call Mr. Power now."</p>

<p>The last Sacrament was then devotionally received by
the dying man, his pastor, the Marquis, and Mr.
Ravensworth. Then the Earl, whose breathing became
short and painful, expressed a wish to be left alone for
some short time. He kissed Augusta, and pressed the
hand of his friends, who adjourned to the ante-room,
so as to be in hearing of the slightest call. They
heard his difficult breathing grow shorter and fainter,
till at last the gasps were few and very distant from
each other, and then ceased to be heard.</p>

<p>"He must be sleeping," said the Marquis. "I will
go and see."</p>

<p>He stole to the bedside. The Earl's hands were
clasped in the attitude of prayer, his lips slightly parted,
his eyes closed,&mdash;and for ever! Through the door of
his lips the breath no longer flowed. The feather held
to his mouth was unswayed,&mdash;the mirror untarnished.
Without a sigh he had passed away, and had calmly
sunk into his long last sleep, smiling while all around
him wept.</p>

<p>"Weep not so, my child," said Mr. Power to Augusta,
as she threw herself on her father's breast. "Weep not
so. Your papa is happy now, and in heaven with your
mamma."</p>

<p>But the child wept on, till her uncle and grandfather
gently drew her from the scene, each resolving he would
be all to that fatherless, motherless little girl, that ever
her fond parents could have been, had they been spared
to her youthful years.</p>

<h2><a name="CONCLUSION" id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION.</h2>


<p>Our tale is finished. We have seen the curse, pronounced
long ages ago, fulfilled on a whole race! Each
in the flower of her age, each in the pride of his strength,
has been remorselessly cut down by Death.</p>

<p>First the accomplished Edith, burned on the night of
the wedding-ball of her brother; next the fair-haired
Florence, broken-hearted at her young lover's death;
then Frank, on the field of glory; then the terrible
death of the Captain shocked us, and the self-wrought
doom of the unhappy Edward L'Estrange, the hero of the
book,&mdash;the unhappy, ill-starred man, who should have
lived and died, as his happier brother the Earl lived and
died. Our heroine, Ellen, faithful to death, fulfilled her
promise, Ruth-like, to go where her husband went; to
lodge where he lodged; his people became her people,
and her God his! When he died she died, and nought
parted them&mdash;not even death! We cannot dismiss our
favourite without a few passing words on her character.</p>

<p>In early youth, too much tinged with romance, she
committed a great fault, for we must not shut our eyes
to the fact,&mdash;she most decidedly jilted her first lover for
the young Earl. Our readers may excuse her if they
like. We might excuse her,&mdash;but she never excused
herself! True she really loved him not, and the Earl
was her first true love; but she learned a bitter lesson,
how wrong it was to encourage what she could not reciprocate;
how wrong to lead on a lover to distraction!
Ah! hearts are brittle ware, and easily broken! Ellen
then committed <i>one</i> great fault!&mdash;but her whole life
suffered for it; never was sin more bitterly visited. Our
readers, however indulgently they may view her error,
must mark the fatal consequences one swerve from
<span class="smcap">TRUTH</span> entailed on herself and all connected with her.</p>

<p>And now we need only add that the Earl and Countess
were laid side by side, followed to the tomb by the
whole surrounding neighbourhood&mdash;high and low, rich
and poor; no eye unwet; no voice but praised the
dead, and sympathized with the poor little orphan
Countess.</p>

<p>Another orphan sympathized and wept with Augusta,&mdash;Caroline
Lennox, who had safely returned home.</p>

<p>We now leave the story to our readers' acceptance,
and conclude with the best wish&mdash;that from these incidents
the young may learn to follow the good, and to
forsake the wrong. That it is better to live, and die,
like the Earl and his Countess, than like Captain de
Vere, or the unhappy Edward L'Estrange!</p>

<p>The Protector, as is well known, died on the anniversary of
his two greatest victories.</p>

<p>The 3rd of September, 1650, beheld him victor at Dunbar, the
3rd of September, 1651, at Worcester; the 3rd of September,
1658, he yielded up his ambitious soul.</p>

<p>A terrific hurricane swept over England the night he died,
and it is worthy of record that a similar convulsion of the
elements took place at the deaths of Napoleon Bonaparte, Pitt,
George IV., and other men of note.</p>


<p><a name="Note_B_" id="Note_B_"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39982/39982-h/39982-h.htm#FNanchor_B_"><i>Note</i> B, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 10.</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Weird of the Wentworths.</span></p>

<p><i>Weird</i>, derived from the Saxon, means <i>fated</i>; it is here used
as a substantive; more frequently it is found adjectively, <i>e.g.</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The <i>weird</i> sisters, hand in hand."&mdash;<i>Macbeth.</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To the <i>weird</i> lady of the woods."&mdash;<i>Old Ballad.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sir Walter Scott uses it as a substantive throughout his novels.
<i>Vide</i> Guy Mannering, chap. xlvi. "The Weird's Dreed."</p>

<p>The original <i>weird</i>, <i>curse</i>, or <i>fate</i>, is to be found in the archives
of a good English family; I forget where I read it, but it made
a great impression on my mind.</p>

<p>The name <i>Wentworth</i> is selected merely as one connected with
the author's family, and has no historic reference to the Straffords,
or any other title in our peerage.</p>


<p><a name="Note_C_" id="Note_C_"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39982/39982-h/39982-h.htm#FNanchor_C_"><i>Note</i> C, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 55.</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Queen's Drive.</span></p>

<p>The road <i>probably</i> did not exist, <i>certainly</i> not as the "Queen's
Drive," at the time of our tale. If any critic catches up the
anachronism, I can only defend myself with Cowper's lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"No matter when, a poet's muse is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make them grow just where she chooses."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The descriptions are drawn from nature, and the impressions
those which a tour, in the loveliest weather, through the romantic
country created in the author's mind. He, however, believes
he has crowned Rigi with an hotel before due time.</p>


<p><a name="Note_E_" id="Note_E_"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39982/39982-h/39982-h.htm#FNanchor_E_"><i>Note</i> E, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 140.</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Devil's Bridge.</span></p>

<p><i>Le Pont du Diable</i> is a thread-like bridge spanning a tremendous
gap made by the Reuss through the rocks near Fluellen.
The author, with some friends, saw it under the circumstances
here described, and the little incident narrated actually took
place among the party.</p>


<p><a name="Note_F_" id="Note_F_"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39982/39982-h/39982-h.htm#FNanchor_F_"><i>Note</i> F, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 148.</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Towers.</span></p>

<p>Though the main topics of the scenery are true to nature, it is
almost needless to say no such castles as the Towers ever existed
near the Lammermoors save in imagination. The same may be
said of the scenery in the next few chapters. Individually each
spot is as faithful a picture of <i>some</i> place as the author could
draw, but <i>en masse</i> they are grouped without any attention to
topography beyond the general resemblance one spot has to
another in Scotland's romantic land.</p>


<p><a name="Note_G_" id="Note_G_"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39982/39982-h/39982-h.htm#FNanchor_G_"><i>Note</i> G, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 237.</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Justifiable Suicide.</span></p>

<p>The author is aware that some demur may be raised against
the lawfulness of suicide under <i>any</i> circumstances, and that many
deem it irreconcileable with a Christian profession in <i>every</i> contingency.
He begs to leave it an open question. During the
Indian mutiny, and in similar cases of certain death by human
violence, he believes that suicide was not only attempted, but
committed, by truly religious persons. The moral character of
the heroine was only gradually developing itself, and he trusts
all final judgment upon her will be reserved till the close of the
romance.</p>


<p><a name="Note_H_" id="Note_H_"></a><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/39982/39982-h/39982-h.htm#FNanchor_H_"><i>Note</i> H, <i>vol.</i> i, <i>p.</i> 258.</a>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Rebecca.</span></p>

<p>Owing to corresponding incidents a certain resemblance to the
celebrated scene in <i>Ivanhoe</i> was almost unavoidable; the author
hopes he has steered clear of any intentional likeness, but if he
has caught a faint echo from the immortal Scott, he is not
ashamed to own it. "<i>Sequiturque patrem, non passibus &aelig;quis.</i>"</p>

<p>The scene at Lady Arranmore's funeral was taken from the
description of the impressive and beautiful ceremony performed
on the occasion of the late deeply lamented Prince Consort's
sepulture.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
